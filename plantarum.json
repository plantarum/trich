  {"id":"AdamackGruber_2014","abstract":"Using scripting languages such as R to perform population genetic analyses can improve the reproducibility of research, but using R can be challenging for many researchers due to its steep learning curve. PopGenReport is a new R package that simplifies performing population genetics analyses in R, through the use of a new report-generating function. The function popgenreport allows users to perform up to 13 pre-defined and 1 user-defined analyses through the use of a single command line. Each analysis generates figures and tables that are incorporated into a pdf report and are also made available as individual files (figures are provided in multiple formats, table contents are provided as csv files). The package includes new R functions that simplify the importation of data from a spreadsheet file, examine allele distributions across populations and loci and identify private alleles, determine pairwise individual genetic distances using the methods of Smouse and Peakall () and Kosman and Leonard (), respectively, detect the presence of null alleles, calculate allelic richness, and test for spatial autocorrelation in genotypes using the methods of Smouse and Peakall (). The package has a modular structure that makes the process of adding new functionality straightforward. To facilitate the addition of user-designed functions, the package includes a fully customizable module that can be automatically included in the pdf report. To support users not experienced in R, the website (www.popgenreport.org) has a tutorial for the package and a downloadable, portable version of the package with LaTeX pre-configured for the Windows operating system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Adamack","given":"Aaron T."},{"family":"Gruber","given":"Bernd"}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12158","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12158","page":"384-387","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"PopGenReport: simplifying basic population genetic analyses in R","title-short":"PopGenReport","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12158","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"Agren_1988","abstract":"The flowering and fruiting patterns of the dioecious perennial herb Rubus chamaemorus L. were studied in frost-prone (open) and frost-sheltered (shaded) habitats in northern Sweden over 6 years. The number of ramets with flower buds, the proportion of flower buds that opened, and fruit set varied markedly between years. In the frost-prone populations, the occurrence or absence of detrimental frosts during the development of flowers and fruit could explain much of the variation, both in the proportion of flower buds that developed into flowers, and in fruit set. In the frost-sheltered populations, most female flowers that did not develop into fruit aborted without any signs of physical damage and before any ovules had begun to enlarge. Flower mortality caused by herbivores feeding on reproductive parts was commonly low, but reached values higher than 10% in one of the shaded populations. Hand-pollination increased the proportion of ovules producing seeds in the mature fruits by about 20%, and in one year also increased fruit set significantly in one population. Fruit-producing female ramets had a higher mortality and a lower probability of flowering in the subsequent year than male ramets and non-fruiting female ramets. In R. chamaemorus, the conditions for fruit maturation are highly unpredictable at the time of flower initiation. It is suggested that the apparent \"over-initiation\" of flower buds is advantageous, as it allows the plant to attain a high reproductive success in years favourable for flowering and fruit development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,20]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Ågren","given":"Jon"}],"container-title":"Oecologia","ISSN":"0029-8549","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1988]]},"page":"175-183","publisher":"Springer","source":"JSTOR","title":"Between-Year Variation in Flowering and Fruit Set in Frost-Prone and Frost-Sheltered Populations of Dioecious Rubus chamaemorus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4218655","volume":"76"},

  {"id":"AllendorfEtAl_2013","abstract":"Loss of biodiversity is among the greatest problems facing the world today. Conservation and the Genetics of Populations gives a comprehensive overview of the essential background, concepts, and tools needed to understand how genetic information can be used to conserve species threatened with extinction, and to manage species of ecological or commercial importance. New molecular techniques, statistical methods, and computer programs, genetic principles, and methods are becoming increasingly useful in the conservation of biological diversity. Using a balance of data and theory, coupled with basic and applied research examples, this book examines genetic and phenotypic variation in natural populations, the principles and mechanisms of evolutionary change, the interpretation of genetic data from natural populations, and how these can be applied to conservation. The book includes examples from plants, animals, and microbes in wild and captive populations. This second edition contains new chapters on Climate Change and Exploited Populations as well as new sections on genomics, genetic monitoring, emerging diseases, metagenomics, and more. One-third of the references in this edition were published after the first edition. Each of the 22 chapters and the statistical appendix have a Guest Box written by an expert in that particular topic (including James Crow, Louis Bernatchez, Loren Rieseberg, Rick Shine, and Lisette Waits).

  {"id":"AngeloniEtAl_2011","abstract":"Inbreeding is common in plants and can have considerable effects on population viability, because of inbreeding depression. Understanding what determines the magnitude of inbreeding depression is of fundamental importance for conservation biology. We used meta-analysis of 116 studies and 107 plant species to investigate the effects of population size, test environment, life history characteristics and stage on the magnitude of inbreeding depression in 13 different fitness traits. We found that inbreeding depression levels significantly increase with population size. This may be a consequence of either, or both, a higher baseline of the level of inbreeding or increased impact of purging in small populations; unfortunately the available data did not allow distinguishing between these potential explanations. In general, inbreeding depression was found to be common across species and environments, and was significant in all traits examined. Yet, the magnitude of inbreeding depression was significantly influenced by plant longevity and life-history stage, and varied depending on how plant fitness was measured. Our findings highlight the fundamental role of population size in influencing the magnitude of inbreeding depression in plants. This clearly has important implications for conservation biology. Moreover, our findings on the overall generality of inbreeding depression confirm that inbreeding depression is one of the key factors reducing plant population fitness and viability. Hence, we need a better understanding on the architecture of inbreeding depression, how different ecological and historical conditions influence the levels of inbreeding depression in natural plant populations, and its impacts on community dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Angeloni","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Ouborg","given":"N.

  {"id":"BahnMcGill_2007","abstract":"Aim Distribution modelling relates sparse data on species occurrence or abundance to environmental information to predict the population of a species at any point in space. Recently, the importance of spatial autocorrelation in distributions has been recognized. Spatial autocorrelation can be categorized as exogenous (stemming from autocorrelation in the underlying variables) or endogenous (stemming from activities of the organism itself, such as dispersal). Typically, one asks whether spatial models explain additional variability (endogenous) in comparison to a fully specified habitat model. We turned this question around and asked: can habitat models explain additional variation when spatial structure is accounted for in a fully specified spatially explicit model? The aim was to find out to what degree habitat models may be inadvertently capturing spatial structure rather than true explanatory mechanisms. Location We used data from 190 species of the North American Breeding Bird Survey covering the conterminous United States and southern Canada. Methods We built 13 different models on 190 bird species using regression trees. Our habitat-based models used climate and landcover variables as independent variables. We also used random variables and simulated ranges to validate our results. The two spatially explicit models included only geographical coordinates or a contagion term as independent variables. As another angle on the question of mechanism vs. spatial structure we pitted a model using related bird species as predictors against a model using randomly selected bird species. Results The spatially explicit models outperformed the traditional habitat models and the random predictor species outperformed the related predictor species. In addition, environmental variables produced a substantial R2 in predicting artificial ranges. Main conclusions We conclude that many explanatory variables with suitable spatial structure can work well in species distribution models. The predictive power of environmental variables is not necessarily mechanistic, and spatial interpolation can outperform environmental explanatory variables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bahn","given":"Volker"},{"family":"McGill","given":"Brian J."}],"container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00331.x","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00331.x","page":"733-742","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Can niche-based distribution models outperform spatial interpolation?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00331.x","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"BanerjeeEtAl_2019","abstract":"Similarity of climatic niches occupied by a species in its native and invasive ranges has been recognized as one of the key factors for successful invasion. Accounting for changes in climatic niche over time may provide better understanding of the dynamic biological invasion process. We investigated these changes for an invasive alien plant Mikania micrantha in South and Southeast Asia, Australia, Oceania and parts of the USA. Based on documented occurrences over 200 years (1800-2017), we reconstructed the introduction history of the species and estimated climatic niche dynamics for the presumed invasion routes. We estimated niche conservatism and the environmental analogy between native and invasive ranges and used ecological niche modelling to identify the potential distribution of M. micrantha under current and future climate change scenarios. Our study identified six pathways through which the species was presumably introduced from its native range. Climatic conditions of the initial introduction sites were found to be similar to those in the native niche. However, the species occupied climatic niches in dry and cold areas over time, being outside of the limits of the realized climatic niche of its native range. The climatic niche dynamics also differed between the invasion pathways with variable time lag. This pattern of niche change over time was found to be consistent in future. Nearly 20% of the invasive range was found to be climatically suitable for this species and was predicted to expand towards cold and dry areas of the invasive range affecting nearly half of the global biodiversity hotspots. By analyzing M. micrantha invasion at a time scale, this study revealed multiple introduction pathways, variation in climatic niche dynamics among invasion routes, and potential range expansion of the species in its invasive range. Although further experimental and molecular studies are needed to explain these findings fully, this study highlights the need for temporally explicit approaches towards better understanding and successful management of biological invasions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Achyut Kumar"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Wuxia"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yelin"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

Additionally, we used these data to assess whether the populations of V. myrtillus disjunct\nbetween North America and Eurasia are monophyletic and should continue to be recognized as conspecific. Significant genome-wide introgression, as determined through D-statistic analyses, was detected between North American samples of V. myrtillus and V. cespitosum, and\nto a lesser extent, between V. myrtillus and V. scoparium. No significant D-values were detected between V. scoparium and V. cespitosum. Accessions of Vaccinium myrtillus from Eurasia and North America were recovered as non-monophyletic, prompting\nour proposed resurrection of V. oreophilum for North American material. The long-assumed sister species relationship between V. oreophilum and V. scoparium was not recovered in our analysis. Instead, V. oreophilum and V. cespitosum were inferred to be sister\ntaxa. This study reveals considerable introgression detectable in the evolutionary history of western North American bilberries and demonstrates the utility of RADseq data to resolve species level relationships in groups that undergo reticulate evolution such as Vaccinium.","author":[{"family":"Beeler","given":"Reese B."},{"family":"Sharples","given":"Mathew T."},{"family":"Tripp","given":"Erin A."}],"container-title":"Systematic Botany","container-title-short":"Systematic Botany","DOI":"10.1600/036364420X15935294613383","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,11]]},"page":"576-584","source":"IngentaConnect","title":"Introgression Among Three Western North American Bilberries (Vaccinium section Myrtillus)","type":"article-journal","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"BianchiEtAl_2017","abstract":"Hemispherical photography (HP), implemented with cameras equipped with “fisheye” lenses, is a widely used method for describing forest canopies and light regimes. A promising technological advance is the availability of low-cost fisheye lenses for smartphone cameras. However, smartphone camera sensors cannot record a full hemisphere. We investigate whether smartphone HP is a cheaper and faster but still adequate operational alternative to traditional cameras for describing forest canopies and light regimes. We collected hemispherical pictures with both smartphone and traditional cameras in 223 forest sample points, across different overstory species and canopy densities. The smartphone image acquisition followed a faster and simpler protocol than that for the traditional camera. We automatically thresholded all images. We processed the traditional camera images for Canopy Openness (CO) and Site Factor estimation. For smartphone images, we took two pictures with different orientations per point and used two processing protocols: (i) we estimated and averaged total canopy gap from the two single pictures, and (ii) merging the two pictures together, we formed images closer to full hemispheres and estimated from them CO and Site Factors. We compared the same parameters obtained from different cameras and estimated generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) between them. Total canopy gap estimated from the first processing protocol for smartphone pictures was on average significantly higher than CO estimated from traditional camera images, although with a consistent bias. Canopy Openness and Site Factors estimated from merged smartphone pictures of the second processing protocol were on average significantly higher than those from traditional cameras images, although with relatively little absolute differences and scatter. Smartphone HP is an acceptable alternative to HP using traditional cameras, providing similar results with a faster and cheaper methodology. Smartphone outputs can be directly used as they are for ecological studies, or converted with specific models for a better comparison to traditional cameras.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Bianchi","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Cahalan","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Hale","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Gibbons","given":"James Michael"}],"container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.3567","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.3567","page":"10556-10566","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Rapid assessment of forest canopy and light regime using smartphone hemispherical photography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.3567","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"BoyceEtAl_2002","abstract":"A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyce","given":"Mark S"},{"family":"Vernier","given":"Pierre R"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Scott E"},{"family":"Schmiegelow","given":"Fiona K.

  {"id":"BriscoeRunquistEtAl_2019","abstract":"Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) is an annual plant native to the desert Southwest of the United States and Mexico and has become invasive and caused large economic losses across much of the United States. In order to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of past invasion, and to predict future invasion, we developed a broad array of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, we constructed sequential SDMs throughout the invasion history and asked how well those predicted future invasion (1970 to present). We showed that invasion occurred from a restricted set of environments in the native range to a diverse set in the invaded range. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that rapid range expansion was facilitated by stochastic, long-distance dispersal events. Regardless of SDM approach, all SDMs built using datasets from early in the invasion (1970–2010) performed poorly and failed to predict most of the current invaded range. Together, these results suggest that climate is unlikely to have influenced early stages of range expansion. SDMs that incorporated data from the most recent sampling (2011–2017) performed considerably better, predicted high suitability in regions that have recently become invaded, and identified mean annual temperature as a key factor limiting northward range expansion. Under future climates, models predicted both further northward range expansion and significantly increased suitability across large portions of the U.S. Overall, our results indicate significant challenges for SDMs of invasive species far from climate equilibrium. However, our models based on recent data make more robust predictions for northward range expansion of A. palmeri with climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Briscoe Runquist","given":"Ryan D."},{"family":"Lake","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Tiffin","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Moeller","given":"David A."}],"container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-38054-9","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,20]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"2426","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Species distribution models throughout the invasion history of Palmer amaranth predict regions at risk of future invasion and reveal challenges with modeling rapidly shifting geographic ranges","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38054-9","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"BroennimannEtAl_2012","abstract":"Aim Concerns over how global change will influence species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in evolutionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data. Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geographical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space to multivariate environmental space independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space. However, the use of ordination and species distribution model techniques for selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrasting results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographical distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Broennimann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Matthew C."},{"family":"Pearman","given":"Peter B."},{"family":"Petitpierre","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"Pellissier","given":"Loïc"},{"family":"Yoccoz","given":"Nigel G."},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Fortin","given":"Marie-Josée"},{"family":"Randin","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Niklaus E."},{"family":"Graham","given":"Catherine H."},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"}],"container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00698.x","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00698.x","page":"481-497","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Measuring ecological niche overlap from occurrence and spatial environmental data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00698.x","volume":"21"},

Wild populations face threats both from deterministic factors, e.g., habitat loss, overexploitation, pollution, and introduced species, and from stochastic events of a demographic, genetic, and environmental nature, including catastrophes. Inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness in naturally outbreeding species, but its role in extinctions of wild populations is controversial. To evaluate critically the role of inbreeding in extinction, we conducted realistic population viability analyses of 20 threatened species, with and without inbreeding depression, using initial population sizes of 50, 250, and 1000. Inbreeding markedly decreased median times to extinction by 28.5, 30.5, and 25% for initial populations of 50, 250, and 1000, respectively, and the impacts were similar across major taxa. The major variable explaining differences among species was initial population growth rate, whereas the impact of inbreeding was least in species with negative growth rates. These results demonstrate that the prospects for survival of threatened species will usually be seriously overestimated if genetic factors are disregarded, and that inappropriate recovery plans may be instituted if inbreeding depression is ignored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Brook","given":"Barry W."},{"family":"Tonkyn","given":"David W."},{"family":"O'Grady","given":"Julian J."},{"family":"Frankham","given":"Richard"}],"container-title":"Conservation Ecology","ISSN":"1195-5449","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"publisher":"Resilience Alliance Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"Contribution of inbreeding to extinction risk in threatened species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26271855","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"Brown_1984","abstract":"There appears to be a general relationship between abundance and distribution that has two parts. First, within species, population density tends to be greatest in the center of the range and to decline gradually toward the boundaries. This pattern holds over a range of spatial scales from steep environmental gradients within local regions to the entire geographic range. Exceptions include: (1) abrupt changes in abundance that usually correspond to sharp, discontinuous changes in single environmental variables; and (2) multimodal patterns of abundance that are caused by environmental patchiness. The second general relationship is that among closely related, ecologically similar species spatial distribution is positively correlated with average abundance. Again this pattern holds over a variety of spatial scales from local regions to entire geographic ranges. These empirical patterns have already been reported in the literature, but their generality is demonstrated by analysis of additional data for diverse kinds of organisms. A single general theory accounts for these observations and follows logically from three assumptions. First, the abundance and distribution of each species are limited by the combination of physical and biotic environmental variables that determines the multidimensional niche. Second, spatial variation in these environmental variables is somewhat stochastic but autocorrelated, so that nearby sites tend to have more similar environmental conditions than more distant ones. Third, closely related, ecologically similar species differ in no more than a very few niche dimensions. A more formal model can be developed that predicts that under these assumptions the distribution of population density over space should approximate a normal probability density distribution. Most exceptions to this predicted pattern can be explained as cases in which assumptions of the model are clearly violated. This paper represents an example of a statistical approach that should be useful for investigating complex ecological systems comprised of many components, such as species of many individuals or communities of many species. The general relationships between abundance and distribution developed here eventually should contribute to our understanding of the biogeography, population genetics, and evolution of species as well as the ecological attributes of populations and communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"James H."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/284267","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1984,8,1]]},"page":"255-279","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"On the relationship between abundance and distribution of species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/284267","volume":"124"},

The findings contribute to our general understanding of pollination ecology at high latitudes and provide important information for the commercialization of cloudberry. Female flowers were smaller than males but provided more nectar, although this resource was low in both sexes. Insects from 43 families visited cloudberry flowers, yet four families (Apidae, Halictidae, Muscidae, Syrphidae) represented ca. 87% of all visitors observed. Introduction experiments revealed that apids and muscids are significantly poorer pollinators (based on fruit production) than halictids and syrphids, but when fruit mass or seed set was considered, there were no significant differences between families. Pollinator importance, a product of flower visitation frequency and seed set effectiveness, revealed that the dipterans were of paramount importance to the pollination of cloudberry. Furthermore, they are limited to cloudberry because their lapping mouthparts exclude them from accessing the nutritional rewards of competing Ericaceae flowers. While the total number of pollinator families observed suggest a generalist pollination system, if one considers the dominant pollinators (flies) as a functional group, then this insect–flower relationship could be considered a specialized one.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Adam O."},{"family":"McNeil","given":"Jeremy N."}],"container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.3732/ajb.0800102","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.0800102","page":"1096-1107","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Pollination ecology of the high latitude, dioecious cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus; Rosaceae)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.0800102","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Busch_2005","abstract":"Inbreeding depression is one of the leading factors preventing the evolution of self-fertilization in plants. In populations where self-fertilization evolves, theory suggests that natural selection against partially recessive deleterious alleles will reduce inbreeding depression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the magnitude of inbreeding depression in self-incompatible and self-compatible populations of Leavenworthia alabamica. Within-population crosses were conducted to compare the quantity and quality of offspring produced by outcrossing and self-fertilization. These progeny were grown in a common greenhouse and inbreeding depression was measured in germination, survival, biomass, transition rate to flowering, flower number, petal length, pollen grains/anther, pollen viability, and ovule number. In comparison to outcrossing, self-fertilization led to the production of fewer and smaller seeds within self-incompatible populations. Moreover, inbreeding depression was observed in eight of 11 offspring traits within self-incompatible populations of L. alabamica. In contrast, there was significant inbreeding depression only in flower number within self-compatible populations. The results of this study are consistent with the idea that self-fertilization selectively removes partially recessive deleterious alleles causing inbreeding depression in natural plant populations. However, in plant species such as L. alabamica where self-compatibility may evolve in small populations following long-distance dispersal, declines in inbreeding depression may also be facilitated by genetic drift.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Busch","given":"J.

However, because long-distance seed dispersal is inherently hard to measure, there are few data sets that characterize the tails of seed dispersal curves. This paper is structured around two lines of argument. First, we argue that long-distance seed dispersal is of critical importance and, hence, that we must collect better data from the tails of seed dispersal curves. To make the case for the importance of long-distance seed dispersal, we review existing data and models of long-distance seed dispersal, focusing on situations in which seeds that travel long distances have a critical impact (colonization of islands, Holocene migrations, response to global change, metapopulation biology). Second, we argue that genetic methods provide a broadly applicable way to monitor long-distance seed dispersal; to place this argument in context, we review genetic estimates of plant migration rates. At present, several promising genetic approaches for estimating long-distance seed dispersal are under active development, including assignment methods, likelihood methods, genealogical methods, and genealogical/demographic methods.

  {"id":"CasagrandeEtAl_2018","abstract":"Despite their importance as invasive species, there has been a hesitation to target grasses in classical biocontrol. This historic bias appears to be changing with multiple active research and release programs. Similarly, biocontrol workers appear to avoid targeting species with native congeners. These biases appear inappropriate as the ecological and entomological literature provide abundant evidence for sub-genus specificity for many herbivores, including those attacking grasses. The biocontrol program targeting Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud (Poaceae) provides an informative example with endemic subspecies in North America and many sub-genus specific herbivores, including potential European control agents. Grasses and target weeds with congeneric native species require rigorous host range testing, similar to all other targets in current weed biological control programs. Furthermore, it appears prudent to ask petition reviewers and regulatory agencies to abandon their focus on results of no-choice studies and to distinguish between trivial feeding and demographic impacts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Casagrande","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Häfliger","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Hinz","given":"Hariet L."},{"family":"Tewksbury","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Blossey","given":"Bernd"}],"container-title":"BioControl","container-title-short":"BioControl","DOI":"10.1007/s10526-018-9871-y","ISSN":"1573-8248","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"391-403","source":"Springer Link","title":"Grasses as appropriate targets in weed biocontrol: is the common reed, Phragmites australis, an anomaly?","title-short":"Grasses as appropriate targets in weed biocontrol","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10526-018-9871-y","volume":"63"},
  {"id":"CastoeEtAl_2012","abstract":"Identification of microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), can be a time-consuming and costly investment requiring enrichment, cloning, and sequencing of candidate loci. Recently, however, high throughput sequencing (with or without prior enrichment for specific SSR loci) has been utilized to identify SSR loci. The direct “Seq-to-SSR” approach has an advantage over enrichment-based strategies in that it does not require a priori selection of particular motifs, or prior knowledge of genomic SSR content. It has been more expensive per SSR locus recovered, however, particularly for genomes with few SSR loci, such as bird genomes. The longer but relatively more expensive 454 reads have been preferred over less expensive Illumina reads. Here, we use Illumina paired-end sequence data to identify potentially amplifiable SSR loci (PALs) from a snake (the Burmese python, Python molurus bivittatus), and directly compare these results to those from 454 data. We also compare the python results to results from Illumina sequencing of two bird genomes (Gunnison Sage-grouse, Centrocercus minimus, and Clark's Nutcracker, Nucifraga columbiana), which have considerably fewer SSRs than the python. We show that direct Illumina Seq-to-SSR can identify and characterize thousands of potentially amplifiable SSR loci for as little as $10 per sample – a fraction of the cost of 454 sequencing. Given that Illumina Seq-to-SSR is effective, inexpensive, and reliable even for species such as birds that have few SSR loci, it seems that there are now few situations for which prior hybridization is justifiable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Castoe","given":"Todd A."},{"family":"Poole","given":"Alexander W."},{"family":"Koning","given":"A.

  {"id":"CattonEtAl_2016","abstract":"Understanding the impact of herbivory on plant populations is a fundamental goal of ecology. Damage to individual plants can be visually striking and affect the fates of individuals, but these impacts do not necessarily translate into population-level differences in vital rates (survival, growth, or fecundity) or population growth rates. In biological control of weeds, quantitative assessments of population-level impacts of released agents on both target invasive plants and native, nontarget plants are needed to inform evaluations of the benefits and risks of releasing agents into new regions. Here we present a 3-yr experimental demographic field study using the European root-feeding biocontrol weevil, Mogulones crucifer, first released in Canada in 1997 to control the invasive weed Cynoglossum officinale (Boraginaceae). Mogulones crucifer is an effective “search and destroy” agent in Canada, but sporadically feeds, oviposits, and develops on native nontarget Boraginaceae. We investigated the population-level impacts of this biocontrol insect on its target weed and a native nontarget plant, Hackelia micrantha (Boraginaceae), by releasing large numbers of weevils into naturally occurring patches of H. micrantha growing isolated from or interspersed with C. officinale. We followed the fates of individual plants on release and nonrelease (control) sites for two transition years, developed matrix models to project population growth rates (λ) for each plant species, and examined the contributions from differences in vital rates to changes in λ using life table response experiments (LTRE). In contrast to studies of the insect–plant interaction in its native range, as a biocontrol agent, M. crucifer increased mortality of C. officinale rosettes in the year immediately following release, depressing the weed's λ to below the population replacement level. However, λ for H. micrantha was never depressed below the replacement level, and any differences between release and nonrelease sites in the nontarget could not be explained by significant contributions from vital rates in the LTRE. This study is the first to simultaneously and experimentally examine target and nontarget population-level impacts of a weed biocontrol insect in the field, and supports the theoretical prediction that plant life history characteristics and uneven herbivore host preferences can interact to produce differences in population-level impacts between target and nontarget plant species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Catton","given":"Haley A."},{"family":"Lalonde","given":"Robert G."},{"family":"Buckley","given":"Yvonne M."},{"family":"Clerck‐Floate","given":"Rosemarie A.

The present study addresses the relationships of the major clades in Boraginaceae s.str. with an emphasis on monophyly of, and relationships between previously recognized clades and the position of various unplaced genera such as Afrotysonia, Anoplocaryum, Brachybotrys, Chionocharis, Craniospermum, Thyrocarpus, and Trigonocaryum using three plastid markers and a taxon sampling with four outgroup and 170 ingroup species from 73 genera. The phylogeny shows high statistical support for most nodes on the backbone and within individual clades. Echiochileae are confirmed as sister to the remainder of Boraginaceae s.str., which, in turn, fall into two well-supported clades, the Boragineae + Lithospermeae and the Cynoglosseae s.l. The latter is highly resolved and includes the Lasiocaryum-clade (Chionocharis, Lasiocaryum, Microcaryum) and the Trichodesmeae (Caccinia, Trichodesma) as sister to the remainder of the group. Rochelieae (formerly the Eritrichieae s.str., also including Eritrichium, Hackelia, and Lappula) form a poorly supported polytomy together with the Mertensia-clade (also including Anoplocaryum, Asperugo, and Memoremea) and the Omphalodes-clade. The enigmatic genus Craniospermum (Craniospermeae) is sister to an expanded Myosotideae (also including Brachybotrys, Decalepidanthus, Trigonocaryum, and Trigonotis) and these two clades are in turn sister to the Core-Cynoglosseae, in which Afrotysonia glochidiata and Thyrocarpus sampsonii are included. Core-Cynoglosseae again fall into two pairs of well-supported subclades. The majority of generic placements are now resolved satisfactorily and the remaining phylogenetic questions can be clearly delimited.

A population's probability of extinction is directly correlated with its variability and inversely correlated with density and immigration rate5,6,7,8,9. This has led to the prediction that, when a species becomes endangered, its geographical range should contract inwards, with the core populations persisting until the final stages of decline2,10.

The presence of semi-natural areasfavorable to pollination is a key factor for achieving this objective of sustainability. Sowing mixtures ofdicotyledonous plants that are rich in pollen and nectar as flower strips along field margins is an efficientsolution to attract pollinators and to support their foraging activity on arable land. The enhancement ofagroecosystems requires operational methods that make it possible to assess the impact of existing andsown semi-natural areas on pollination. We developed here a new predictive indicator that can be usedat the field margin and floral levels, which predicts the pollination value of floral diversity and abundanceof field margins on arable land.We based the predictive indicator on decision trees using “if-then” linguistic rules because of the lackof sufficient quantitative knowledge about the relationships between floral traits and pollination. Thisapproach makes it possible to use quantitative and qualitative information. We associated fuzzy subsetsto the decision trees and the classes of variables in order to avoid the knife-edge effect of class limits. Atthe species level, the indicator depends on three criteria: (i) visual attractiveness in terms of flower size,color and UV reflection; (ii) flower accessibility according to the botanical family, the symmetry and theshape of the flower; and (iii) the reward linked to pollen and nectar quantity and quality. An aggregationprocedure allows us to obtain a value at the field margin level for each month as a function of theflowering period and pollination activity. Examples of calculations for honeybees, wild bees, bumblebeesand hoverflies are shown.The evaluation of the predictive quality yielded significant correlations between pollinator abundanceand the indicator value. The level of correlation is satisfying for this type of indicator, which might befurther improved with additional data on plant traits. Coupling this indicator with a model that assessesthe impact of management on plant diversity and abundance will be a further step to help agronomistswho work on the improvement of arable farming management in order to lower its negative impact onpollination.","author":[{"literal":"Charles Ricou"},{"family":"Schneller","given":"Chloé"},{"family":"Amiaud","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Plantureux","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Bockstaller","given":"Christian"}],"container-title":"Ecological Indicators","issue":"45","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,25]]},"page":"320-331","title":"A vegetation-based indicator to assess the pollinationvalue of field margin flora","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X14001241"},

M. cruciger can complete full development on species within closely-related genera in the Boraginaceae, but prefers houndstongue as a host. Of the 22 species of native North American Boraginaceae that were tested in this study, nine species from four genera within the tribe Eritrichieae ( Cryptantha, Hackelia, Mertensia and Lappula ) clearly supported development of M. cruciger . However, generally these non-target species experienced less attack by M. cruciger relative to houndstongue. There were differences in the incidence and degree of attack depending on the test type, which included the use of potted test plants in laboratory no-choice and open-field choice situations. The least non-target attack occurred on rangeland in British Columbia, Canada, where potted test plants were introduced into sites where the insect had been previously released on houndstongue. These results suggest that M. cruciger has a narrow ecological host range. Special emphasis was placed on testing species of Cryptantha because C. crassipes is listed as endangered in the USA. Six of 12 Cryptantha species tested supported full development, but generally, the incidence and intensity of attack were less for these species relative to houndstongue. There was no, or incomplete development, on tested species of Plagiobothrys , a genus that contains two species listed as endangered in the USA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Clerck-Floate","given":"R.

  {"id":"CrnokrakBarrett_2002","abstract":"Abstract.— Inbreeding depression, the reduction in fitness that accompanies inbreeding, is one of the most important topics of research in evolutionary and conservation genetics. In the recent literature, much attention has been paid to the possibility of purging the genetic load. If inbreeding depression is due to deleterious alleles, whose effect on fitness are negative when in a homozygous state, then successive generations of inbreeding may result in a rebound in fitness due to the selective decrease in frequency of deleterious alleles. Here we examine the experimental evidence for purging of the genetic load by collating empirical tests of rebounds in fitness-related traits with inbreeding in animals and plants. We gathered data from 28 studies including five mammal, three insect, one mollusc, and 13 plant species. We tested for purging by examining three measures of fitness-component variation with serial generations of inbreeding: (1) changes in inbreeding depression, (2) changes in fitness components of inbred lines relative to the original outbred line, and (3) purged population (outcrossed inbred lines) trait means as a function of ancestral outbred trait means. Frequent and substantial purging was found using all three measures, but was particularly pronounced when tracking changes in inbreeding depression. Despite this, we found little correspondence between the three measures of purging within individual studies, indicating that the manner in which a researcher chooses to estimate purging will affect interpretation of the results obtained. The discrepancy suggests an alternative hypothesis: rebounds in fitness with inbreeding may have resulted from adaptation to laboratory conditions and not to purging when using outcrossed inbred lines. However, the pronounced reduction in inbreeding depression for a number of studies provides evidence for purging, as the measure is likely less affected by selection for laboratory conditions. Unlike other taxon-specific reviews on this topic, our results provide support for the purging hypothesis, but firm predictions about the situations in which purging is likely or the magnitude of fitness rebound possible when populations are inbred remain difficult. Further research is required to resolve the discrepancy between the results obtained using different experimental approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Crnokrak","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Spencer C.

Literature emphasizing the con tributions of paleoecology to contemporary issues in ecology is growing, but many of the key papers are published in journals not traditionally read by ecologists. The tendency toward increased specialization within ecology, along with the proliferation of new journals as publication outlets, increasingly makes it difficult to communicate effectively across sUbdisciplines within ecology. With this book, we hope to bridge the communication gap between Quaternary ecologists and other ecologists. In this book we do not attempt to cover the subject of Quaternary ecology in a traditional textbook presentation. Two comprehensive books, one contemporary text (Birks and Birks, 1980) and a handbook of techniques (Berglund, 1986) appropriate to various specialties within this field are available to the reader who is interested in the details of methods used in reconstructing past communities and ecosystems.","author":[{"family":"Delcourt","given":"Hazel R."},{"family":"Delcourt","given":"P."}],"ISBN":"978-0-412-29790-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991,7,31]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"258","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Quaternary ecology: a paleoecological perspective","title-short":"Quaternary Ecology","type":"book"},
  {"id":"DelisleEtAl_2003","abstract":"Aim To reconstruct the spread of invasive wetland species using herbarium specimens and to develop a method that accounts for the biases associated with this type of historical record. Location Southern Québec. Methods The temporal and spatial distribution of herbarium specimens of vascular plants was examined. Six invasive species that are mainly found in wetlands were compared with five native, non-expanding hydrophytes. The cumulative number of locations was plotted against time to construct invasion curves. For native species, this ‘invasion curve’ indicates the spatiotemporal distribution of the sampling for herbarium specimens of wetland plants. It also represents the history of the state of knowledge of the distribution of native species. Deviation from the native species invasion curve can be used to describe the spread of invasive species. For every year on record, the cumulative number of locations of each exotic species was divided by the cumulative number of locations of all native species, and the proportions obtained were plotted against time. Periods of invasiveness were then delineated. Results During the twentieth century, two periods of intensive herbarium specimen collection in Québec can be clearly distinguished, i.e. from 1930 to 1940 and from 1950 to 1985. Several periods of invasiveness were delineated for Butomus umbellatus L. (1922–35), Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L. (1957–96), Lycopus europaeus L. (1963–2000), Lythrum salicaria L. (1890–1905, 1923–46), Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel (1963–84) and Rorippa amphibia (L.) Bess. (1929–34, 1943–52, 1971–79). Main conclusions Accounting for sampling biases associated with herbarium specimens is important in order to objectively delineate periods of invasiveness for exotic species. The spread of wetland vascular plant species can be reconstructed using herbarium specimens, even when the phenomenon is rapid, but the reconstruction is certainly more accurate when the invasion occurred during an active sampling period. The highly variable sampling effort for herbarium specimens in Québec and in other regions strongly cautions against using herbarium data without correction procedures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Delisle","given":"Fanny"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Claude"},{"family":"Jean","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Lachance","given":"Daniel"}],"container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00897.x","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00897.x","page":"1033-1042","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Reconstructing the spread of invasive plants: taking into account biases associated with herbarium specimens","title-short":"Reconstructing the spread of invasive plants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00897.x","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"DormannEtAl_2018","abstract":"Aim Recent studies increasingly use statistical methods to infer biotic interactions from co-occurrence information at a large spatial scale. However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can affect co-occurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge. Approach We present a set of questions that analysts and reviewers should ask to avoid erroneously attributing species association patterns to biotic interactions. Our questions relate to the appropriateness of data and models, the causality behind a correlative signal, and the problems associated with static data from dynamic systems. We summarize caveats reported by macroecological studies of biotic interactions and examine whether conclusions on the presence of biotic interactions are supported by the modelling approaches used. Findings Irrespective of the method used, studies that set out to test for biotic interactions find statistical associations in species’ co-occurrences. Yet, when compared with our list of questions, few purported interpretations of such associations as biotic interactions hold up to scrutiny. This does not dismiss the presence or importance of biotic interactions, but it highlights the risk of too lenient interpretation of the data. Combining model results with information from experiments and functional traits that are relevant for the biotic interaction of interest might strengthen conclusions. Main conclusions Moving from species- to community-level models, including biotic interactions among species, is of great importance for process-based understanding and forecasting ecological responses. We hope that our questions will help to improve these models and facilitate the interpretation of their results. In essence, we conclude that ecologists have to recognize that a species association pattern in joint species distribution models will be driven not only by real biotic interactions, but also by shared habitat preferences, common migration history, phylogenetic history and shared response to missing environmental drivers, which specifically need to be discussed and, if possible, integrated into models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dormann","given":"Carsten F."},{"family":"Bobrowski","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Dehling","given":"D.

It is often neglected by ecologists who prefer the widely used methods of redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. We present the co-inertia criterion for measuring the adequacy between two data sets. Co-inertia analysis is based on this criterion as are canonical correspondence analysis or canonical correlation analysis, but the latter two have additional constraints. Co-inertia analysis is very flexible and allows many possibilities for coupling. Co-inertia analysis is suitable for quantitative and/or qualitative or fuzzy environmental variables. Moreover, various weighting of sites and various transformations and/or centering of species data are available for this method. Hence, more ecological considerations can be taken into account in the statistical procedures. Moreover, the principle of this method is very general and can be easily extended to the case of distance matrices or to the case of more than two tables.

Methods: Identification and measurement of spatial structures is a topic of great interest in plant ecology. Univariate measurements of spatial autocorrelation such as Moran's I and Geary's c are widely used, but extensions to the multivariate case (i.e. multi-species) are rare. Here, we propose a multivariate spatial analysis based on Moran's I (MULTISPATI) by introducing a row-sum standardized spatial weight matrix in the statistical triplet notation. This analysis, which is a generalization of Wartenberg's approach to multivariate spatial correlation, would imply a compromise between the relations among many variables (multivariate analysis) and their spatial structure (autocorrelation). MULTISPATI approach is very flexible and can handle various kinds of data (quantitative and/or qualitative data, contingency tables). A study is presented to illustrate the method using a spatial version of Correspondence Analysis. Location: Territoire d'Etude et d'Expérimentation de Trois-Fontaines (eastern France).

  {"id":"EckertEtAl_2008","abstract":"There is growing interest in quantifying genetic population structure across the geographical ranges of species to understand why species might exhibit stable range limits and to assess the conservation value of peripheral populations. However, many assertions regarding peripheral populations rest on the long-standing but poorly tested supposition that peripheral populations exhibit low genetic diversity and greater genetic differentiation as a consequence of smaller effective population size and greater geographical isolation relative to geographically central populations. We reviewed 134 studies representing 115 species that tested for declines in within-population genetic diversity and/or increases in among-population differentiation towards range margins using nuclear molecular genetic markers. On average, 64.2% of studies detected the expected decline in diversity, 70.2% of those that tested for it showed increased differentiation and there was a positive association between these trends. In most cases, however, the difference in genetic diversity between central and peripheral population was not large. Although these results were consistent across plants and animals, strong taxonomic and biogeographical biases in the available studies call for a cautious generalization of these results. Despite the large number of studies testing these simple predictions, very few attempted to test possible mechanisms causing reduced peripheral diversity or increased differentiation. Almost no study incorporated a phylogeographical framework to evaluate historical influences on contemporary genetic patterns. Finally, there has been little effort to test whether these geographical trends in putatively neutral variation at marker loci are reflected by quantitative genetic trait variation, which is likely to influence the adaptive potential of populations across the geographical range.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Eckert","given":"C.

  {"id":"ElithEtAl_2010","abstract":"1. Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models’ assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species. 2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an example, predicting potential distributions under both current and climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of extrapolation. 3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment, particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data. Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario. 4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling software, MaxEnt. Our results also show that deliberately controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in non-equilibrium and novel settings. 5. Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate change. Predictions of future species distributions are required for management, but there are acknowledged problems with many current methods, and relatively few advances in techniques for understanding or overcoming these. The methods presented in this manuscript and made accessible in MaxEnt provide a forward step.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Elith","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Kearney","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Steven"}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x","page":"330-342","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The art of modelling range-shifting species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x","volume":"1"},

In order to make an informed decision land managers need to be able to predict the spread of these invasive species at local scales and without the need for excessive sampling. Our approach uses a hybrid model, combining habitat suitability and the presence of the invasive in neighbouring cells to predict the probability of a cell being invaded over time. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to create a habitat suitability model and a spread model. The habitat suitability model predicts the presence of buckthorn based on environmental characteristics and the results are used in the spread model. The spread model indicates that the invasion of buckthorn is influenced by the suitability of habitat and the presence of buckthorn in neighbouring cells. The success of the spread model suggests that this approach can be used to create a spatiotemporally explicit model with limited sampling effort.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Endicott","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Drescher","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Brenning","given":"Alexander"}],"container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-017-1504-3","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2993-3011","source":"Springer Link","title":"Modelling the spread of European buckthorn in the Region of Waterloo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1504-3","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"ExcoffierEtAl_1992","abstract":"We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Excoffier","given":"L."},{"family":"Smouse","given":"P.

Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed.

  {"id":"FordEtAl_1991","abstract":"Morphological studies of the short-beaked members of Carex sect. Vesicariae have indicated that three species can be recognized: C. saxatilis (incl. C. miliaris and C. physocarpa), C. membranacea, and C. rotundata. To assess genetic relationships among species and gene diversity within species, 44 populations from throughout North America were surveyed electrophoretically for 12 enzymes encoded by 17 putative loci. Populations of the same species exhibited high genetic identities, with average values exceeding 0.950. Interspecific genetic identities ranged from 0.636 (between C. saxatilis and C. rotundata) to 0.880 (C. membranacea and C. rotundata). Alleles for the isozymes AAT-1, AAT-2, 6-PGD, PGI-2, PGM-2, and SKDH were useful in distinguishing C. saxatilis from C. membranacea and C. rotundata. Carex membranacea and C. rotundata were best distinguished by alleles of 6-PGD. There was little allozyme differentiation within the C. saxatilis complex; however, a weak east/west cline was evident. Within populations, observed heterozygosity closely matched expected levels of heterozygosity: F values averaged 0.039, indicating outcrossing is prevalent.

  {"id":"FordEtAl_1998","abstract":"A taxonomic study by Naczi, Reznicek, and Ford (American Journal of Botany, 85, 434–447, 1998) has determined that three species (Carex willdenowii, C. basiantha, and C. superata) can be recognized within the C. willdenowii complex. To determine the amount of genetic divergence within and between these species, allozyme analyses were conducted on 14 populations distributed from Pennsylvania to eastern Texas. Seventeen loci were surveyed, 13 of which were polymorphic, with all populations being polymorphic at one or more loci. Interspecific genetic identities ranged from 0.560 (C. willdenowii and C. basiantha) to 0.807 (C. basiantha and C. superata). Alleles for the isozymes Aat-1, Dia-1, Idh-2, Mdh-2, Per-1, Pgm-1, and Pgm-2 served to distinguish C. willdenowii from C. basiantha and C. superata. Carex basiantha and C. superata were recognized by alleles of Mdh-2, Pgm-1, and Tpi-2. The genetic identities of populations within species were high and exceeded 0.957. A caespitose growth habit and perigynia in close proximity to the staminate flowers suggest adaptations for selfing and therefore low levels of heterozygosity. Paradoxically, the values for expected heterozygosities (Hexp) were always lower than those obtained by direct count (Hobs): F values were highly negative, indicating heterozygous excess. Disassortative mating and selection are discussed as possible mechanisms for maintaining heterozygous excess within populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ford","given":"Bruce A."},{"family":"McQueen","given":"D.

It highlights three conservation strategies: communities conserved in nature reserves; individual species conserved in nature reserves or botanic gardens; and domesticated plants, preserved mainly in germplasm collections. Because conservation biology has such a broad scope and relevance to the community at large, it is faced with several controversial issues such as the dichotomy between the preservation of individual species versus a broader focus on the ecosystem; the relative importance to give to endangered species; the design and management of reserves and the value of corridors; and the drive for increasing agricultural productivity through plant improvement versus the drive to maintain traditional peasant varieties in cultivation. Here, these and other issues are examined, by emphasizing and exploring the underlying scientific principles.

  {"id":"Frankham_2015","abstract":"Many species have fragmented distribution with small isolated populations suffering inbreeding depression and/or reduced ability to evolve. Without gene flow from another population within the species (genetic rescue), these populations are likely to be extirpated. However, there have been only 20 published cases of such outcrossing for conservation purposes, probably a very low proportion of populations that would potentially benefit. As one impediment to genetic rescues is the lack of an overview of the magnitude and consistency of genetic rescue effects in wild species, I carried out a meta-analysis. Outcrossing of inbred populations resulted in beneficial effects in 92.9% of 156 cases screened as having a low risk of outbreeding depression. The median increase in composite fitness (combined fecundity and survival) following outcrossing was 148% in stressful environments and 45% in benign ones. Fitness benefits also increased significantly with maternal ΔF (reduction in inbreeding coefficient due to gene flow) and for naturally outbreeding versus inbreeding species. However, benefits did not differ significantly among invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. Evolutionary potential for fitness characters in inbred populations also benefited from gene flow. There are no scientific impediments to the widespread use of outcrossing to genetically rescue inbred populations of naturally outbreeding species, provided potential crosses have a low risk of outbreeding depression. I provide revised guidelines for the management of genetic rescue attempts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Frankham","given":"Richard"}],"container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.13139","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.13139","page":"2610-2618","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Genetic rescue of small inbred populations: meta-analysis reveals large and consistent benefits of gene flow","title-short":"Genetic rescue of small inbred populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13139","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"FrankhamEtAl_2011","abstract":"Abstract: Fragmentation of animal and plant populations typically leads to genetic erosion and increased probability of extirpation. Although these effects can usually be reversed by re-establishing gene flow between population fragments, managers sometimes fail to do so due to fears of outbreeding depression (OD). Rapid development of OD is due primarily to adaptive differentiation from selection or fixation of chromosomal variants. Fixed chromosomal variants can be detected empirically. We used an extended form of the breeders’ equation to predict the probability of OD due to adaptive differentiation between recently isolated population fragments as a function of intensity of selection, genetic diversity, effective population sizes, and generations of isolation. Empirical data indicated that populations in similar environments had not developed OD even after thousands of generations of isolation. To predict the probability of OD, we developed a decision tree that was based on the four variables from the breeders’ equation, taxonomic status, and gene flow within the last 500 years. The predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations is elevated when the populations have at least one of the following characteristics: are distinct species, have fixed chromosomal differences, exchanged no genes in the last 500 years, or inhabit different environments. Conversely, the predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations of the same species is low for populations with the same karyotype, isolated for <500 years, and that occupy similar environments. In the former case, we recommend crossing be avoided or tried on a limited, experimental basis. In the latter case, crossing can be carried out with low probability of OD. We used crosses with known results to test the decision tree and found that it correctly identified cases where OD occurred. Current concerns about OD in recently fragmented populations are almost certainly excessive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Frankham","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ballou","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Eldridge","given":"Mark D.

Methods Three approaches were considered: (1) incorporating models of species migration to understand the ability of a species to occupy suitable habitat in new locations; (2) linking models of landscape disturbance and succession to models of habitat suitability; and (3) fully linking models of habitat suitability, habitat dynamics and spatially explicit population dynamics. Results Linking species–environment relationships, landscape dynamics and population dynamics in a multi-modelling framework allows the combined impacts of climate change (affecting species distribution and vital rates) and land cover dynamics (land use change, altered disturbance regimes) on species to be predicted. This approach is only feasible if the life history parameters and habitat requirements of the species are well understood. Main conclusions Forecasts of the impacts of global change on species may be improved by considering multiple causes. A range of methods are available to address the interactions of changing habitat suitability, habitat dynamics and population response that vary in their complexity, realism and data requirements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Franklin","given":"Janet"}],"container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00641.x","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00641.x","page":"321-330","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Moving beyond static species distribution models in support of conservation biogeography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00641.x","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"FriedmanBarrett_2009","abstract":"• Monoecy and protogyny are widespread in wind-pollinated plants and have been interpreted as outcrossing mechanisms, though few studies have investigated their function. Carex, a large genus of anemophilous herbs, is predominantly monoecious and many species are protogynous. We investigated whether monoecy and protogyny limit self-pollination in seven Carex species. • We conducted field experiments comparing stigmatic pollen loads and seed set between intact and emasculated stems. We tested for self-compatibility and evaluated pollen limitation of seed set by supplemental pollination. Finally, we measured outcrossing rates in open-pollinated and emasculated stems using allozyme markers. • Emasculated stems captured significantly less pollen than open-pollinated stems and set less seed. Pollen deposition during the female-only phase for intact stems was only 12% of the total captured. Outcrossing rates for three species indicated high selfing (range t = 0.03–0.39). Allozyme loci in the remaining species were monomorphic also suggesting high selfing. These results demonstrate that neither monoecy nor protogyny is particularly effective at limiting self-fertilization. • Selection for the avoidance of selfing is unlikely to maintain monoecy in many Carex species although protogyny may provide limited opportunities for outcrossing. We propose that geitonogamy in self-compatible wind-pollinated species with unisexual flowers may be widespread and provides reproductive assurance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Friedman","given":"Jannice"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Spencer C.

Here, we describe an emerging modelling approach, ΔTraitSDM, which attempts to achieve this by explaining species distribution ranges based on phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation of fitness-related traits measured across large geographical gradients. The collection of intraspecific trait data measured in common gardens spanning broad environmental clines has promoted the development of these new models – first in trees but now rapidly expanding to other organisms. We review, explain and harmonize the main findings from this new generation of models that, by including trait variation over geographical scales, are able to provide new insights into future species ranges. Overall, ΔTraitSDM predictions generally deliver a less alarming message than previous models of species distribution under new climates, indicating that phenotypic plasticity should help, to a considerable degree, some plant populations to persist under climate change. The development of ΔTraitSDMs offers a new perspective to analyse intraspecific variation in single and multiple traits, with the rationale that trait (co)variation and consequently fitness can significantly change across geographical gradients and new climates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Garzón","given":"Marta Benito"},{"family":"Robson","given":"T.

Five leaf-feeding moths were also considered for further investigations. Field observations and preliminary host range tests with the stem-boring beetle Oberea pedemontana, the root-boring moth Synanthedon stomoxiformis, the shoot-tip-boring moth Sorhagenia janiszewskae and the leaf-feeding moths Ancylis apicella, A. unculana, Triphosa dubitata, Philereme transversata and P. vetulata confirmed that all of these species were lacking host specificity in no-choice conditions. Choice oviposition tests carried out with most of the prioritized species to assess their ecological host range yielded unreliable results. Three psyllids, Trichochermes walkeri, Cacopsylla rhamnicolla and Trioza rhamni are promising in terms of host specificity, but are infected with the plant disease ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma rhamni’.

However, it was not possible to obtain adult fruiting trees of native North American Rhamnus species for testing.

Distinguishing the contribution of ecological, historical, and stochastic processes to the origin and maintenance of biogeographic boundaries, however, is a longstanding challenge. Taking advantage of newly available data and methods—including environmental niche models and associated comparative metrics—we develop a framework to test two possible ecological explanations for biogeographic boundaries: (1) sharp environmental gradients and (2) ribbons of unsuitable habitat dividing two highly suitable regions. We test each of these hypotheses against the null expectation that environmental variation across a given boundary is no greater than expected by chance. We apply this framework to a pair of Hispaniolan Anolis lizards (A. chlorocyanus and A. coelestinus) distributed on the either side of this island's most important biogeographic boundary. Integrating our results with historical biogeographic analysis, we find that a ribbon of particularly unsuitable habitat is acting to maintain a boundary between species that initially diverged on distinct paleo-islands, which merged to form present-day Hispaniola in the Miocene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Glor","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Warren","given":"Dan"}],"container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01177.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01177.x","page":"673-683","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Testing Ecological Explanations for Biogeographic Boundaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01177.x","volume":"65"},
  {"id":"GodtEtAl_1996","abstract":"Allozyme diversity was examined in four rare, high-montane plant species from the Appalachian Mountains of southeastern North America. These species may represent relictual members or descendants of an alpine community that was more widespread during the late Pleistocene. We sampled five populations of Geum radiatum (Rosaceae), Carex misera (Cyperaceae), Trichophorum cespitosum (Cyperaceae), and the four known populations of Calamagrostis cainii (Poaceae). Genetic diversity was low for all species but was typical of that found for plant species with limited ranges. Low genetic diversity may reflect historical events associated with changes in the species’ biogeography. As the Pleistocene climate warmed, suitable habitat decreased in areal extent and became fragmented, probably resulting in smaller, more-isolated populations. In recent times these species, which co-occur in fragile rock outcrop habitats, have been adversely affected by human activities. Genetic analyses revealed reduced diversity in populations of decreasing size for three species. Estimates of gene flow were low (Nm < 1.0) in all four species. Positive associations between genetic diversity and population size, evidence of recent population declines, and the low estimates of gene flow suggest that genetic drift may play a prominent role in shaping the present-day genetic composition of these species. Furthermore, these data suggest that the genetically depauperate populations are unlikely to regain genetic variation without human intervention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Godt","given":"Mary Jo W."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Bart R."},{"family":"Hamrick","given":"J.

The response of species to changing environments is likely to be determined largely by population responses at range margins. In contrast to the expanding edge, the low-latitude limit (rear edge) of species ranges remains understudied, and the critical importance of rear edge populations as long-term stores of species’ genetic diversity and foci of speciation has been little acknowledged. We review recent findings from the fossil record, phylogeography and ecology to illustrate that rear edge populations are often disproportionately important for the survival and evolution of biota. Their ecological features, dynamics and conservation requirements differ from those of populations in other parts of the range, and some commonly recommended conservation practices might therefore be of little use or even counterproductive for rear edge populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hampe","given":"Arndt"},{"family":"Petit","given":"Rémy J."}],"container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00739.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00739.x","page":"461-467","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Conserving biodiversity under climate change: the rear edge matters","title-short":"Conserving biodiversity under climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00739.x","volume":"8"},

We outline the strengths and weaknesses of available climate projections, the uncertainty associated with future projections at different spatial and temporal scales, the differences between available downscaling methods (dynamical, statistical downscaling, and simple scaling of global circulation model output), and the implications these have for ecological models.

  {"id":"HeimpelEtAl_2010","abstract":"We consider the possibility of an extensive invasional meltdown occurring in central North America involving eleven Eurasian species. The scenario begins with the potential co-facilitation between the European earthworm Lumbricus terrestris and European buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica. Once introduced, European buckthorn has served as the overwintering host for two important invasive crop pests, oat crown rust, Puccinea coronata and the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines. The spread of R. cathartica itself may have been aided by seed dispersal by the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, and the presence of L. terrestris has likely facilitated the invasion of Bipalium adventitium, an Asian predatory flatworm that specializes on earthworms. Beyond this, the soybean aphid is consumed by a number of introduced species, including the lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, the ground beetle Agonum muelleri and the parasitoid Aphelinus certus. We hypothesize that the presence of soybean aphid increases regional abundances of these species. We discuss both the evidence for this multi-species invasional meltdown scenario and potential implications of meltdown dynamics for invasive species management. The particular management issues that we discuss are: (1) opportunities for managing multiple invasive species simultaneously by targeting facilitator species, and (2) implications of meltdown dynamics for biological control introductions against the soybean aphid.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Heimpel","given":"George E."},{"family":"Frelich","given":"Lee E."},{"family":"Landis","given":"Douglas A."},{"family":"Hopper","given":"Keith R."},{"family":"Hoelmer","given":"Kim A."},{"family":"Sezen","given":"Zeynep"},{"family":"Asplen","given":"Mark K."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Kongming"}],"container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-010-9736-5","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2913-2931","source":"Springer Link","title":"European buckthorn and Asian soybean aphid as components of an extensive invasional meltdown in North America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-010-9736-5","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"Hicksetal._2016","abstract":"Planted meadows are increasingly used to improve the biodiversity and aesthetic amenity value of urban areas. Although many ‘pollinator-friendly’ seed mixes are available, the floral resources these provide to flower-visiting insects, and how these change through time, are largely unknown. Such data are necessary to compare the resources provided by alternative meadow seed mixes to each other and to other flowering habitats. We used quantitative surveys of over 2 million flowers to estimate the nectar and pollen resources offered by two exemplar commercial seed mixes (one annual, one perennial) and associated weeds grown as 300m2 meadows across four UK cities, sampled at six time points between May and September 2013. Nectar sugar and pollen rewards per flower varied widely across 65 species surveyed, with native British weed species (including dandelion, Taraxacum agg.) contributing the top five nectar producers and two of the top ten pollen producers. Seed mix species yielding the highest rewards per flower included Leontodon hispidus, Centaurea cyanus and C. nigra for nectar, and Papaver rhoeas, Eschscholzia californica and Malva moschata for pollen. Perennial meadows produced up to 20x more nectar and up to 6x more pollen than annual meadows, which in turn produced far more than amenity grassland controls. Perennial meadows produced resources earlier in the year than annual meadows, but both seed mixes delivered very low resource levels early in the year and these were provided almost entirely by native weeds. Pollen volume per flower is well predicted statistically by floral morphology, and nectar sugar mass and pollen volume per unit area are correlated with flower counts, raising the possibility that resource levels can be estimated for species or habitats where they cannot be measured directly. Our approach does not incorporate resource quality information (for example, pollen protein or essential amino acid content), but can easily do so when suitable data exist. Our approach should inform the design of new seed mixes to ensure continuity in floral resource availability throughout the year, and to identify suitable species to fill resource gaps in established mixes.","author":[{"family":"Hicks","given":"Damien M."},{"family":"et al.","given":""}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0158117","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,24]]},"title":"Food for Pollinators: Quantifying the Nectar and Pollen Resources of Urban Flower Meadows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158117","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"HirzelEtAl_2006","abstract":"Models predicting species spatial distribution are increasingly applied to wildlife management issues, emphasising the need for reliable methods to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions. As many available datasets (e.g. museums, herbariums, atlas) do not provide reliable information about species absences, several presence-only based analyses have been developed. However, methods to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions are few and have never been validated. The aim of this paper is to compare existing and new presence-only evaluators to usual presence/absence measures. We use a reliable, diverse, presence/absence dataset of 114 plant species to test how common presence/absence indices (Kappa, MaxKappa, AUC, adjusted D2) compare to presence-only measures (AVI, CVI, Boyce index) for evaluating generalised linear models (GLM). Moreover we propose a new, threshold-independent evaluator, which we call “continuous Boyce index”. All indices were implemented in the BIOMAPPER software. We show that the presence-only evaluators are fairly correlated (ρ>0.7) to the presence/absence ones. The Boyce indices are closer to AUC than to MaxKappa and are fairly insensitive to species prevalence. In addition, the Boyce indices provide predicted-to-expected ratio curves that offer further insights into the model quality: robustness, habitat suitability resolution and deviation from randomness. This information helps reclassifying predicted maps into meaningful habitat suitability classes. The continuous Boyce index is thus both a complement to usual evaluation of presence/absence models and a reliable measure of presence-only based predictions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirzel","given":"Alexandre H."},{"family":"Le Lay","given":"Gwenaëlle"},{"family":"Helfer","given":"Véronique"},{"family":"Randin","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"}],"collection-title":"Predicting Species Distributions","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.05.017","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,11,16]]},"language":"en","page":"142-152","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Evaluating the ability of habitat suitability models to predict species presences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006002468","volume":"199"},
  {"id":"HoldereggerEtAl_2006","abstract":"Genetic diversity is important for the maintenance of the viability and the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations and species. However, there are two principal types of genetic diversity: adaptive and neutral – a fact widely neglected by non-specialists. We introduce these two types of genetic diversity and critically point to their potential uses and misuses in population or landscape genetic studies. First, most molecular-genetic laboratory techniques analyse neutral genetic variation. This means that the gene variants detected do not have any direct effect on fitness. This type of genetic variation is thus selectively neutral and tells us nothing about the adaptive or evolutionary potential of a population or a species. Nevertheless, neutral genetic markers have great potential for investigating processes such as gene flow, migration or dispersal. Hence, they allow us to empirically test the functional relevance of spatial indices such as connectivity used in landscape ecology. Second, adaptive genetic variation, i.e. genetic variation under natural selection, is analysed in quantitative genetic experiments under controlled and uniform environmental conditions. Unfortunately, the genetic variation (i.e. heritability) and population differentiation at quantitative, adaptive traits is not directly linked with neutral genetic diversity or differentiation. Thus, neutral genetic data cannot serve as a surrogate of adaptive genetic data. In summary, neutral genetic diversity is well suited for the study of processes within landscapes such as gene flow, while the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations or species has to be assessed in quantitative genetic experiments. Landscape ecologists have to mind these differences between neutral and adaptive genetic variation when interpreting the results of landscape genetic studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Holderegger","given":"Rolf"},{"family":"Kamm","given":"Urs"},{"family":"Gugerli","given":"Felix"}],"container-title":"Landscape Ecology","container-title-short":"Landscape Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/s10980-005-5245-9","ISSN":"1572-9761","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"797-807","source":"Springer Link","title":"Adaptive vs. neutral genetic diversity: implications for landscape genetics","title-short":"Adaptive vs. neutral genetic diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-005-5245-9","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"HoltsfordEllstrand_1990","abstract":"Inbreeding depression is commonly observed in natural populations. The deleterious effects of forced inbreeding are often thought to be less pronounced in populations with self-pollinating mating systems than in primarily outcrossing populations. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the performance of plants produced by artificial self- and cross-pollination from three populations whose outcrossing rate estimates were 0.03, 0.26, and 0.58. Outcrossing rates and inbreeding coefficients were estimated using isozyme polymorphisms as genetic markers. Analysis of F statistics suggests that biparental inbreeding as well as self-fertilization contribute to the level of homozygosity in the seed crop. Biparental inbreeding will reduce the heterozygosity of progeny produced by outcrossing, relative to random outcrossing expectations, and hence will reduce the effects of outcrossing versus self-fertilization. Heterotic selection may increase the average heterozygosity during the life history. Selfed and outcrossed seeds from all three populations were equally likely to germinate and survive to reproduce. However, inbreeding depression was observed in fecundity traits of plants surviving to reproduction in all three populations. Even in the population whose natural self-fertilization rate was 97%, plants grown from seed produced by self-pollination produced fewer fruits and less total seed weight than plants grown from outcrossed seed. There was no detectable inbreeding depression in estimated lifetime fitness. Inbreeding effects for all reproductive yield characters were most severe in the accession from the most outcrossing population and least severe in the accession from the most self-fertilizing population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Holtsford","given":"Timothy P."},{"family":"Ellstrand","given":"Norman C."}],"container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.1990.tb04309.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1990.tb04309.x","page":"2031-2046","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Inbreeding effects in <i>Clarkia tembloriensis</i> (Onagraceae) populations with different natural outcrossing rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1990.tb04309.x","volume":"44"},

To gain a better understanding of the causes of the high fruit abortion frequency in cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus L.), we manipulated different sources of carbon, that is, leaves and rhizome. We also manipulated flower number to see if competition between floral ramets explained fruit abortion in cloudberry. Reducing the number of flowers had no impact on fruit abortion frequency. In fact, the species forms an extensive rhizome network with only a few ramets per clone and competition between floral ramets is unlikely. Ramet defoliation had limited impact on fruit abortion, but successful fruit development was affected by rhizome length. The longer the rhizome, the higher the chances to mature a fruit. These results suggest that current photoassimilate production by the reproductive ramet alone is insufficient to insure fruit development. Carbon can come from other ramets but distances are usually high between ramets. Fruit production might thus depend on the use of stored carbohydrates in the rhizome to balance insufficient photosynthetic contribution during fruit production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Jean","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Lapointe","given":"Line"}],"container-title":"Physiologia Plantarum","DOI":"10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120311.x","ISSN":"1399-3054","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120311.x","page":"379-387","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Limited carbohydrate availability as a potential cause of fruit abortion in Rubus chamaemorus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120311.x","volume":"112"},

In this paper we propose a new spatially explicit multivariate method, spatial principal component analysis (sPCA), to investigate the spatial pattern of genetic variability using allelic frequency data of individuals or populations. This analysis does not require data to meet Hardy–Weinberg expectations or linkage equilibrium to exist between loci. The sPCA yields scores summarizing both the genetic variability and the spatial structure among individuals (or populations). Global structures (patches, clines and intermediates) are disentangled from local ones (strong genetic differences between neighbors) and from random noise. Two statistical tests are proposed to detect the existence of both types of patterns. As an illustration, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) and sPCA are compared using simulated datasets and real georeferenced microsatellite data of Scandinavian brown bear individuals (Ursus arctos). sPCA performed better than PCA to reveal spatial genetic patterns. The proposed methodology is implemented in the adegenet package of the free software R.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Jombart","given":"T."},{"family":"Devillard","given":"S."},{"family":"Dufour","given":"A.-B."},{"family":"Pontier","given":"D."}],"container-title":"Heredity","DOI":"10.1038/hdy.2008.34","ISSN":"1365-2540","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,7]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"92-103","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Revealing cryptic spatial patterns in genetic variability by a new multivariate method","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy200834/","volume":"101"},

Plant pathogen populations are often clonal or partially clonal which requires different analytical tools. With the advent of high throughput sequencing technologies, obtaining genome-wide population genetic data has become easier than ever before. We previously contributed the R package poppr specifically addressing issues with analysis of clonal populations. In this paper we provide several significant extensions to poppr with a focus on large, genome-wide SNP data. Specifically, we provide several new functionalities including the new function mlg.filter to define clone boundaries allowing for inspection and definition of what is a clonal lineage, minimum spanning networks with reticulation, a sliding-window analysis of the index of association, modular bootstrapping of any genetic distance, and analyses across any level of hierarchies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Kamvar","given":"Zhian N."},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Jonah C."},{"family":"Grünwald","given":"Niklaus J."}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Genetics","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"KirkEtAl_2011","abstract":"• Premise of the study: The Eurasian subspecies of the common reed (Phragmites australis subsp. australis, hereafter abbreviated as P. a. australis) was introduced to North America in the late 18th century and rapidly expanded its range, posing an ecological threat to wetlands. In this study, we aimed to determine whether admixture among multiple lineages, dispersal mechanisms, and high genetic diversity have contributed to the invasion of P. a. australis in the northeastern part of its range. Understanding mechanisms of the P. a. australis invasion will 1) contribute to a broader understanding of the factors that facilitate plant invasion, and 2) help us to develop effective management strategies for wetlands threatened by P. a. australis invasion. • Methods: We used a population genetics approach incorporating nine microsatellite loci to study genetic diversity and population structure in relation to biogeography of introduced North American Phragmites a. australis stands in the northeastern continental region. • Key Results: Phragmites a. australis is genetically diverse in the region studied here. Significant population structure exists, and population structure is likely influenced by both long-distance dispersal via major waterways, and short-distance dispersal overland. Different lineages sometimes colonize geographically proximate locations leading to opportunities for admixture. Clonal reproduction likely exaggerates geographical structure among some stands, although high genetic and clonal diversity within some stands implies that sexual reproduction occurs frequently in P. a. australis. • Conclusions: A variety of factors, including admixture among multiple lineages, multiple modes of dispersal, and plasticity in reproductive strategy promote the invasion success of Phragmites a. australis. Wetland managers in the St. Lawrence River/Great Lakes region should focus monitoring efforts on the shores of conservation lands to prevent the establishment of propagules from novel lineages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirk","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Straka","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Freeland","given":"Joanna R."}],"container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.3732/ajb.1000278","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.1000278","page":"1180-1190","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Long-distance dispersal and high genetic diversity are implicated in the invasive spread of the common reed, Phragmites australis (Poaceae), in northeastern North America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.1000278","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"KirkpatrickBarton_1997","abstract":"Gene flow from the center of a species' range can stymie adaptation at the periphery and prevent the range from expanding outward. We study this process using simple models that track both demography and the evolution of a quantitative trait in a population that is continuously distributed in space. Stabilizing selection acts on the trait and favors an optimum phenotype that changes linearly across the habitat. One of three outcomes is possible: the species will become extinct, expand to fill all of the available habitat, or be confined to a limited range in which it is sufficiently adapted to allow population growth. When the environment changes rapidly in space, increased migration inhibits local adaptation and so decreases the species' total population size. Gene flow can cause enough maladaptation that the peripheral half of a species' range acts as a demographic sink. The trait's genetic variance has little effect on species persistence or the size of the range when gene flow is sufficiently strong to keep population densities far below the carrying capacity throughout the range, but it can increase the range width and population size of an abundant species. Under some conditions, a small parameter change can dramatically shift the balance between gene flow and local adaptation, allowing a species with a limited range to suddenly expand to fill all the available habitat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirkpatrick","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Barton","given":"N.

The dataset includes 13,939 taxa and covers 1,029 regions (including 381 islands). The dataset is based on 210 data sources. For each taxon-by-region combination, we provide information on whether the taxon is considered to be naturalized in the specific region (i.e. has established self-sustaining populations in the wild). Non-native taxa are marked as “alien”, when it is not clear whether they are naturalized. To facilitate alignment with other plant databases, we provide for each taxon the name as given in the original data source and the standardized taxon and family names used by The Plant List Version 1.1 (http://www.theplantlist.org/). We provide an ESRI shapefile including polygons for each region and information on whether it is an island or a mainland region, the country and the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG) regions it is part of (TDWG levels 1–4). We also provide several variables that can be used to filter the data according to quality and completeness of alien taxon lists, which vary among the combinations of regions and data sources.

  {"id":"KoellingEtAl_2011","abstract":"Self-fertilization is a common mating system in plants and is known to reduce genetic diversity, increase genetic structure and potentially put populations at greater risk of extinction. In this study, we measured the genetic diversity and structure of two cedar glade endemic species, Leavenworthia alabamica and L. crassa. These species have self-incompatible (SI) and self-compatible (SC) populations and are therefore ideal for understanding how the mating system affects genetic diversity and structure. We found that L. alabamica and L. crassa had high species-level genetic diversity (He=0.229 and 0.183, respectively) and high genetic structure among their populations (FST=0.45 and 0.36, respectively), but that mean genetic diversity was significantly lower in SC compared with SI populations (SC vs SI, He for L. alabamica was 0.065 vs 0.206 and for L. crassa was 0.084 vs 0.189). We also found significant genetic structure using maximum-likelihood clustering methods. These data indicate that the loss of SI leads to the loss of genetic diversity within populations. In addition, we examined genetic distance relationships between SI and SC populations to analyze possible population history and origins of self-compatibility. We find there may have been multiple origins of self-compatibility in L. alabamica and L. crassa. However, further work is required to test this hypothesis. Finally, given their high genetic structure and that individual populations harbor unique alleles, conservation strategies seeking to maximize species-level genetic diversity for these or similar species should protect multiple populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Koelling","given":"V.

  {"id":"LakeEtAl_2020","abstract":"Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to forecast potential range expansion of invasive species. However, invasive species occurrence datasets often have spatial biases that may violate key SDM assumptions. In this study, we examined alternative methods of spatial bias correction and multiple methods for model evaluation for seven invasive plant species. Location North America. Taxon Common Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), Wild Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), Leafy Spurge (Euphorbia virgata), Common Teasel (Dipsacus fullonum), Brown Knapweed (Centaurea jacea), Black Swallowwort (Vincetoxicum nigrum) and Dalmatian Toadflax (Linaria dalmatica). Methods We employed bias-correction measures for both occurrence sampling and background sampling inputs in a factorial design for Maxent resulting in six potential models for each species. We evaluated our models for complexity, model fit and using commonly employed evaluation metrics: AUC, partial AUC, the continuous Boyce index and sensitivity. We then developed a structured process for model selection. Results Models developed without occurrence or background bias correction often were overly complex and did not transfer well to expanding range fronts. Conversely, models that employed occurrence and/or background bias-correction measures were less complex, had better AICc scores and had greater projection into incipient areas. These simpler models were also more likely to be selected when evaluated using a process that integrated multiple evaluation metrics. We found that invasion history (e.g. established versus incipient) was associated with the effectiveness of spatial bias correction techniques. Main Conclusions While challenges exist in building climate-based correlative species distribution models for invasive species, we found that methods relying on maximizing AUC performed poorly for invasive species. We advocate for the use of multiple and diverse metrics for model evaluation. Users of species distribution models need to incorporate explicit consideration of model discrimination, model fit and model complexity into their decision-making processes if they are to build biologically realistic models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lake","given":"Thomas A."},{"family":"Runquist","given":"Ryan D.

  {"id":"LawsonEtAl_2012","abstract":"1. There is a pressing need to understand how to facilitate species’ range shifts under climate change. However, few empirical studies are available to inform decision-making, particularly at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. 2. We present a case study of a thermally constrained habitat specialist, the silver-spotted skipper butterfly Hesperia comma, at its expanding range margin in south-eastern Britain. Using data from 724 habitat patches over a 9-year interval (2000–2009), we examined local and landscape determinants of colonization, survival and population density. We then predicted probabilities of colonization and survival for habitat patches under the observed 1982 and 2009 distributions to investigate how the factors limiting range expansions change through space and time. 3. Between 2000 and 2009, Hesperia comma continued to expand its range in Britain, but the 67 recorded colonization events were offset by 48 local extinctions. Extinctions were strongly linked to climate, occurring predominantly in cooler regions and on shaded north-facing slopes. 4. Population density and probability of survival were closely related to conditions within a site, whereas probability of colonization was largely determined by functional connectivity. Survival probability was also influenced by connectivity, suggesting that immigration helped to support extinction-prone populations (a ‘rescue effect’). 5. Patch occupancy beyond the range margin was primarily constrained by colonization, but close to the expanding front, population survival became the key limiting factor. This pattern was conserved during range expansion, altering management priorities at individual sites. 6. Synthesis and applications. Previous studies on facilitating range shifts have stressed the need to increase landscape-scale connectivity to remove constraints on colonization, and our data substantiate this advice. However, we show that enhancing population survival can also help to facilitate range expansions, because populations at leading range edges face high extinction risk. Population survival can be improved directly through local management actions, such as enlarging patch size and increasing habitat quality, or indirectly by improving connectivity. Thus, local management can secure vulnerable populations at the range edge and provide larger and more stable migrant sources for future expansion and deserves consideration when facilitating range shifts under climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lawson","given":"Callum R."},{"family":"Bennie","given":"Jonathan J."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Chris D."},{"family":"Hodgson","given":"Jenny A."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Robert J."}],"container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02098.x","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02098.x","page":"552-561","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Local and landscape management of an expanding range margin under climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02098.x","volume":"49"},

The need for parameterization of the bivariate spatial dependence is precipitated by the realization that aspatial bivariate association measures, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient, do not recognize spatial distributional aspects of data sets. This study devises an L statistic by integrating Pearson's r as an aspatial bivariate association measure and Moran's I as a univariate spatial association measure.

It is commonly assumed that geographic range limits reflect ecological niche limits and that species experience increasingly marginal conditions towards the edge of their ranges. Using spatial data and ecological niche models we tested these hypotheses in Arabidopsis lyrata. Specifically, we asked whether range limits coincide with predicted niche limits in this system and whether the suitability of sites declines towards the edge of the species’ range in North America. We further explored patterns of environmental change towards the edge of the range and asked whether genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity decline with increasing peripherality and environmental marginality. Our results suggest that latitudinal range limits coincide with niche limits. Populations experienced increasingly marginal environments towards these limits – though patterns of environmental change were more complex than most theoretical models for range limits assume. Genomic diversity declined towards the edge of the species’ range and with increasing distance from the estimated centre of the species’ niche in environmental space, but not with the suitability of sites based on niche model predictions. Thus while latitudinal range limits in this system are broadly associated with niche limits, the link between environmental conditions and genetic diversity (and thus the adaptive potential of populations) is less clear.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee‐Yaw","given":"Julie A."},{"family":"Fracassetti","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Willi","given":"Yvonne"}],"container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/ecog.02869","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecog.02869","page":"622-634","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Environmental marginality and geographic range limits: a case study with <i>Arabidopsis lyrata</i> ssp. <i>lyrata</i>","title-short":"Environmental marginality and geographic range limits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.02869","volume":"41"},

Yet, our knowledge of the coupling between species range shifts and isotherm shifts remains limited. Here, we introduce BioShifts—a global geo-database of 30,534 range shifts. Despite a spatial imbalance towards the most developed regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a taxonomic bias towards the most charismatic animals and plants of the planet, data show that marine species are better at tracking isotherm shifts, and move towards the pole six times faster than terrestrial species. More specifically, we find that marine species closely track shifting isotherms in warm and relatively undisturbed waters (for example, the Central Pacific Basin) or in cold waters subject to high human pressures (for example, the North Sea). On land, human activities impede the capacity of terrestrial species to track isotherm shifts in latitude, with some species shifting in the opposite direction to isotherms. Along elevational gradients, species follow the direction of isotherm shifts but at a pace that is much slower than expected, especially in areas with warm climates. Our results suggest that terrestrial species are lagging behind shifting isotherms more than marine species, which is probably related to the interplay between the wider thermal safety margin of terrestrial versus marine species and the more constrained physical environment for dispersal in terrestrial versus marine habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lenoir","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Bertrand","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Comte","given":"Lise"},{"family":"Bourgeaud","given":"Luana"},{"family":"Hattab","given":"Tarek"},{"family":"Murienne","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Grenouillet","given":"Gaël"}],"container-title":"Nature Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1038/s41559-020-1198-2","ISSN":"2397-334X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,25]]},"language":"en","page":"1-16","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Species better track climate warming in the oceans than on land","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1198-2"},

Populations occurring on the edge of a species' range tend to be smaller, more isolated, and more genetically and ecologically divergent than central populations. The combination of these characteristics can impart novel evolutionary potential and local ecological significance, thus heightening their conservation value, while also making them less viable and more prone to local extinction. Public policy supports the conservation of peripheral populations, despite the commonness of the species elsewhere. However, the conservation of significant peripheral populations of nonlisted plants has been arbitrary and ineffective. The absence of explicit criteria to determine the conservation value of peripheral plant populations, the lack of finer-scale data on plant distributions, and a general unawareness of their value have hindered efforts to conserve them.

The conservation value of peripheral populations depends upon their genetic divergence from other conspecific populations. Peripheral populations are expected to diverge from central populations as a result of the interwoven effects of isolation, genetic drift, and natural selection. Available empirical evidence suggests that peripheral populations are often genetically and morphologically divergent from central populations. The long-term conservation of species is likely to depend upon the protection of genetically distinct populations.

We investigate the predictivity of geographic patterns of genetic variation based on geographic and environmental marginality using published genetic diversity data for 40 species (insects, plants, birds, mammals, worms). Only about half of species showed positive relationships between geographic and environmental marginality.

We used six weed species (three highly invasive and three less invasive non-indigenous species) that have been established in the U.S. for more than 75 years. The experiment involved providing non-U. S. location data to users familiar with one of the four evaluated techniques, who then developed predictive models that were applied to the United States without knowing the identity of the species or its U.S. distribution. We compared a simple GIS climate matching technique known as Proto3, a simple climate matching tool CLIMEX Match Climates, the correlative model MaxEnt, and a process model known as the Thornley Transport Resistance (TTR) model. Two experienced users ran each modeling tool except TTR, which had one user. Models were trained with global species distribution data excluding any U.S. data, and then were evaluated using the current known U.S. distribution. The influence of weed species identity and modeling tool on prevalence and sensitivity effects was compared using a generalized linear mixed model. Each modeling tool itself had a low statistical significance, while weed species alone accounted for 69.1 and 48.5% of the variance for prevalence and sensitivity, respectively. These results suggest that simple modeling tools might perform as well as complex ones in the case of predicting potential distribution for a weed not yet present in the United States. Considerations of model accuracy should also be balanced with those of reproducibility and ease of use. More important than the choice of modeling tool is the construction of robust protocols and testing both new and experienced users under blind test conditions that approximate operational conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Magarey","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Newton","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Seung Cheon"},{"family":"Takeuchi","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Christie","given":"David"},{"family":"Jarnevich","given":"Catherine S."},{"family":"Kohl","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Damus","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Higgins","given":"Steven I."},{"family":"Millar","given":"Leah"},{"family":"Castro","given":"Karen"},{"family":"West","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Hastings","given":"John"},{"family":"Cook","given":"Gericke"},{"family":"Kartesz","given":"John"},{"family":"Koop","given":"Anthony L."}],"container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-017-1567-1","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"679-694","source":"Springer Link","title":"Comparison of four modeling tools for the prediction of potential distribution for non-indigenous weeds in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1567-1","volume":"20"},

This variation reflects, in part, differences in ecological tolerance among taxa, but the influence of phylogeny and evolutionary divergence through genome duplication remains controversial. 2. Here, we examine the evolutionary sources of variation in species range area, latitudinal position and overlap, and six range climatic variables (maximum, minimum and breadth of temperature and precipitation) for North American angiosperms. We sampled two diploid and one polyploid species from each of 144 genera and examined sources of variation in a nested taxonomic analysis and congeneric species pairs comparison. 3. For all range characteristics studied, a significant portion of the variance among species (mean 53%, range 37–60%) was attributable to taxonomic membership above species (i.e. genus, family and order). Four of the seven range attributes were significantly correlated between diploid congeners (e.g. range area rs = 0.65) and between heteroploid (diploid and polyploid) congeners (e.g. range area rs = 0.62). The strength of correlations between heteroploid relatives was not consistently different than correlations between diploids. 4. No differences in mean range breadth (range area, temperature breadth, precipitation breadth) or climatological position (minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation) were observed between diploid and polyploid congeners. Polyploids were not more likely to occupy northern latitudinal positions and were no more displaced from diploids than other congeneric diploids. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that, at the scale of North America, the geographical and ecological aspects of species ranges are influenced by phylogenetic history.

Modern human land use has created a mosaic of habitats in many landscapes, including the landscape of the northeastern United States. European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) is an exotic plant that has achieved varying success in North American habitats. We studied dispersal, seed survival, germination, and seedling survival of buckthorn populations at four plots in each of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forests, old fields, and abandoned conifer plantations in central New York State. Dispersal was low in maple forests, as evidenced by low collection rates of R. cathartica seeds in seed traps. Rates of post-dispersal seed predation were highest in maple forests and lowest in old fields, suggesting greater use of maple forests by granivorous rodents. Germination rates did not vary among seeds planted in soils of these habitats when studied in the laboratory despite differences in soil pH. Survival of transplanted seedlings was low in maple forests relative to old fields and plantations. Buckthorn invasion of old fields and abandoned plantations was not strongly constrained by factors we considered, and the buckthorn populations in these habitats were large. A combination of low dispersal by frugivores, low seed survival due to predation, and low seedling survival due to dim light conditions apparently prevents R. cathartica from invasion of intact maple forests of our area.

  {"id":"McKayEtAl_2005","abstract":"Abstract In plant conservation, restoration (the augmentation or reestablishment of an extinct population or community) is a valuable tool to mitigate the loss of habitat. However, restoration efforts can result in the introduction of novel genes and genotypes into populations when plant materials used are not of local origin. This movement is potentially important because many plant species are subdivided into populations that are adapted to local environmental conditions. Here we focus on genetic concerns arising from ongoing restoration efforts, where often little is known about ?How local is local??

We demonstrate the importance of complementing these popular models with spatially explicit, dynamic mechanistic models that link potential and realized distributions. We develop general grid-based, pattern-oriented spread models incorporating three mechanisms—plant population growth, local dispersal, and long-distance dispersal—to predict broadscale spread patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. We use the model to examine the spread of the invasive Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) by Sturnus vulgaris (European starling) across northeastern North America. We find excellent quantitative agreement with historical spread records over the last century that are critically linked to the geometry of heterogeneous landscapes and each of the explanatory mechanisms considered. Spread of bittersweet before 1960 was primarily driven by high growth rates in developed and agricultural landscapes, while subsequent spread was mediated by expansion into deciduous and coniferous forests. Large, continuous patches of coniferous forests may substantially impede invasion. The success of C. orbiculatus and its potential mutualism with S. vulgaris suggest troubling predictions for the spread of other invasive, fleshy-fruited plant species across northeastern North America.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Merow","given":"Cory"},{"family":"LaFleur","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Silander Jr.","given":"John A."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Rubega","given":"Margaret"}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/660295","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,1]]},"page":"30-43","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Developing Dynamic Mechanistic Species Distribution Models: Predicting Bird-Mediated Spread of Invasive Plants across Northeastern North America.","title-short":"Developing Dynamic Mechanistic Species Distribution Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/660295","volume":"178"},
  {"id":"MerowEtAl_2013","abstract":"The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt’s calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt’s outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Merow","given":"Cory"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Silander","given":"John A."}],"container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x","page":"1058-1069","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A practical guide to MaxEnt for modeling species’ distributions: what it does, and why inputs and settings matter","title-short":"A practical guide to MaxEnt for modeling species’ distributions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"MerowEtAl_2017","abstract":"Forecasting ecological responses to climate change, invasion, and their interaction must rely on understanding underlying mechanisms. However, such forecasts require extrapolation into new locations and environments. We linked demography and environment using experimental biogeography to forecast invasive and native species’ potential ranges under present and future climate in New England, United States to overcome issues of extrapolation in novel environments. We studied two potentially nonequilibrium invasive plants’ distributions, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), each paired with their native ecological analogs to better understand demographic drivers of invasions. Our models predict that climate change will considerably reduce establishment of a currently prolific invader (A. petiolata) throughout New England driven by poor demographic performance in warmer climates. In contrast, invasion of B. thunbergii will be facilitated because of higher growth and germination in warmer climates, with higher likelihood to establish farther north and in closed canopy habitats in the south. Invasion success is in high fecundity for both invasive species and demographic compensation for A. petiolata relative to native analogs. For A. petiolata, simulations suggest that eradication efforts would require unrealistic efficiency; hence, management should focus on inhibiting spread into colder, currently unoccupied areas, understanding source–sink dynamics, and understanding community dynamics should A. petiolata (which is allelopathic) decline. Our results—based on considerable differences with correlative occurrence models typically used for such biogeographic forecasts—suggest the urgency of incorporating mechanism into range forecasting and invasion management to understand how climate change may alter current invasion patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Merow","given":"Cory"},{"family":"Bois","given":"Sarah Treanor"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Jenica M."},{"family":"Xie","given":"Yingying"},{"family":"Silander","given":"John A."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1609633114","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,18]]},"language":"en","page":"E3276-E3284","PMID":"28348212","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Climate change both facilitates and inhibits invasive plant ranges in New England","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/16/E3276","volume":"114"},

  {"id":"MuscarellaEtAl_2014","abstract":"Recent studies have demonstrated a need for increased rigour in building and evaluating ecological niche models (ENMs) based on presence-only occurrence data. Two major goals are to balance goodness-of-fit with model complexity (e.g. by ‘tuning’ model settings) and to evaluate models with spatially independent data. These issues are especially critical for data sets suffering from sampling bias, and for studies that require transferring models across space or time (e.g. responses to climate change or spread of invasive species). Efficient implementation of procedures to accomplish these goals, however, requires automation. We developed ENMeval, an R package that: (i) creates data sets for k-fold cross-validation using one of several methods for partitioning occurrence data (including options for spatially independent partitions), (ii) builds a series of candidate models using Maxent with a variety of user-defined settings and (iii) provides multiple evaluation metrics to aid in selecting optimal model settings. The six methods for partitioning data are n−1 jackknife, random k-folds ( = bins), user-specified folds and three methods of masked geographically structured folds. ENMeval quantifies six evaluation metrics: the area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic plot for test localities (AUCTEST), the difference between training and testing AUC (AUCDIFF), two different threshold-based omission rates for test localities and the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc). We demonstrate ENMeval by tuning model settings for eight tree species of the genus Coccoloba in Puerto Rico based on AICc. Evaluation metrics varied substantially across model settings, and models selected with AICc differed from default ones. In summary, ENMeval facilitates the production of better ENMs and should promote future methodological research on many outstanding issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Muscarella","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Galante","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Soley‐Guardia","given":"Mariano"},{"family":"Boria","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Kass","given":"Jamie M."},{"family":"Uriarte","given":"María"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Robert P."}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12261","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12261","page":"1198-1205","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"ENMeval: An R package for conducting spatially independent evaluations and estimating optimal model complexity for Maxent ecological niche models","title-short":"ENMeval","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12261","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"NaimiEtAl_2014","abstract":"Species data held in museum and herbaria, survey data and opportunistically observed data are a substantial information resource. A key challenge in using these data is the uncertainty about where an observation is located. This is important when the data are used for species distribution modelling (SDM), because the coordinates are used to extract the environmental variables and thus, positional error may lead to inaccurate estimation of the species–environment relationship. The magnitude of this effect is related to the level of spatial autocorrelation in the environmental variables. Using local spatial association can be relevant because it can lead to the identification of the specific occurrence records that cause the largest drop in SDM accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we tested whether the SDM predictions are more affected by positional uncertainty originating from locations that have lower local spatial association in their predictors. We performed this experiment for Spain and the Netherlands, using simulated datasets derived from well known species distribution models (SDMs). We used the K statistic to quantify the local spatial association in the predictors at each species occurrence location. A probabilistic approach using Monte Carlo simulations was employed to introduce the error in the species locations. The results revealed that positional uncertainty in species occurrence data at locations with low local spatial association in predictors reduced the prediction accuracy of the SDMs. We propose that local spatial association is a way to identify the species occurrence records that require treatment for positional uncertainty. We also developed and present a tool in the R environment to target observations that are likely to create error in the output from SDMs as a result of positional uncertainty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Naimi","given":"Babak"},{"family":"Hamm","given":"Nicholas A.

In this study, we examine the potential of UAV imagery to track the structural composition and related phenological traits of the dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris on a former military training area. On a European Natura 2000 heathland site, habitat management is shown to be evaluated on the basis of flowering dynamics and reproductive recovery as a proxy of functional changes that are generated after fire destruction. In particular, we utilize true color camera information and digital surface models to determine the spatiotemporal evolution of Calluna life-cycle phases and flowering phenology 2 years after controlled burning. A stepwise methodological framework is presented that extracts Calluna pixels, spatially separates juvenile and mature life-cycle phases, differentiates between generative and vegetative shoot extension and finally quantifies proportions of flowers, fruits and vegetative growth in two consecutive peak flowering periods. We show that Calluna life-cycle phases can be spatially differentiated in pioneer, building and mature phases in UAV imagery. In the juvenile phase, regeneration from germination is low (<10%) and sprouting from the stem base dominates recovery patterns after fire management. The study further reveals that the distribution of flowering and fruiting during peak flowering time is spatially heterogeneous with high variations between years. In the fire unaffected mature phase, proportions of flowers and fruits are reduced indicating a decrease in reproductive capacity of unmanaged Calluna stands. A phenological phase shift is detected from flowering to fruiting that is related to an increase of Calluna growth height. The study shows that the functional patterns of growth and reproduction can be mapped for heathland ecosystems using simple true color drone cameras.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Neumann","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Behling","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Schindhelm","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Itzerott","given":"Sibylle"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Wichmann","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jörg"}],"container-title":"Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation","DOI":"10.1002/rse2.121","ISSN":"2056-3485","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rse2.121","page":"35-51","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The colors of heath flowering – quantifying spatial patterns of phenology in Calluna life-cycle phases using high-resolution drone imagery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rse2.121","volume":"6"},

Short mown grassland designed for recreational use is the dominant form of urban greenspace in temperate regions but requires considerable maintenance and typically provides limited habitat value for most taxa. Alternatives are increasingly proposed, but the biodiversity potential of these is not well understood. In a replicated experiment across six public urban greenspaces, we used nine different perennial meadow plantings to quantify the relative roles of floristic diversity and height of sown meadows on the richness and composition of three taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, and soil microbes. We found that all meadow treatments were colonized by plant species not sown in the plots, suggesting that establishing sown meadows does not preclude further locally determined grassland development if management is appropriate. Colonizing species were rarer in taller and more diverse plots, indicating competition may limit invasion rates. Urban meadow treatments contained invertebrate and microbial communities that differed from mown grassland. Invertebrate taxa responded to changes in both height and richness of meadow vegetation, but most orders were more abundant where vegetation height was longer than mown grassland. Order richness also increased in longer vegetation and Coleoptera family richness increased with plant diversity in summer. Microbial community composition seems sensitive to plant species composition at the soil surface (0–10 cm), but in deeper soils (11–20 cm) community variation was most responsive to plant height, with bacteria and fungi responding differently. In addition to improving local residents’ site satisfaction, native perennial meadow plantings can produce biologically diverse grasslands that support richer and more abundant invertebrate communities, and restructured plant, invertebrate, and soil microbial communities compared with short mown grassland. Our results suggest that diversification of urban greenspace by planting urban meadows in place of some mown amenity grassland is likely to generate substantial biodiversity benefits, with a mosaic of meadow types likely to maximize such benefits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Norton","given":"Briony A."},{"family":"Bending","given":"Gary D."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Corstanje","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Dunnett","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Karl L."},{"family":"Grafius","given":"Darren R."},{"family":"Gravestock","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Grice","given":"Samuel M."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Jim A."},{"family":"Hilton","given":"Sally"},{"family":"Hoyle","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Mercer","given":"Theresa G."},{"family":"Pawlett","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Pescott","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Richards","given":"J.

  {"id":"Nybom_2004","abstract":"A compilation was made of 307 studies using nuclear DNA markers for evaluating among- and within-population diversity in wild angiosperms and gymnosperms. Estimates derived by the dominantly inherited markers (RAPD, AFLP, ISSR) are very similar and may be directly comparable. STMS analysis yields almost three times higher values for within-population diversity whereas among-population diversity estimates are similar to those derived by the dominantly inherited markers. Number of sampled plants per population and number of scored microsatellite DNA alleles are correlated with some of the population genetics parameters. In addition, maximum geographical distance between sampled populations has a strong positive effect on among-population diversity. As previously verified with allozyme data, RAPD- and STMS-based analyses show that long-lived, outcrossing, late successional taxa retain most of their genetic variability within populations. By contrast, annual, selfing and/or early successional taxa allocate most of the genetic variability among populations. Estimates for among- and within-population diversity, respectively, were negatively correlated. The only major discrepancy between allozymes and STMS on the one hand, and RAPD on the other hand, concerns geographical range; within-population diversity was strongly affected when the former methods were used but not so in the RAPD-based studies. Direct comparisons between the different methods, when applied to the same plant material, indicate large similarities between the dominant markers and somewhat lower similarity with the STMS-based data, presumably due to insufficient number of analysed microsatellite DNA loci in many studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nybom","given":"Hilde"}],"container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02141.x","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02141.x","page":"1143-1155","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Comparison of different nuclear DNA markers for estimating intraspecific genetic diversity in plants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02141.x","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"PearsonEtAl_2007","abstract":"Aim Techniques that predict species potential distributions by combining observed occurrence records with environmental variables show much potential for application across a range of biogeographical analyses. Some of the most promising applications relate to species for which occurrence records are scarce, due to cryptic habits, locally restricted distributions or low sampling effort. However, the minimum sample sizes required to yield useful predictions remain difficult to determine. Here we developed and tested a novel jackknife validation approach to assess the ability to predict species occurrence when fewer than 25 occurrence records are available. Location Madagascar. Methods Models were developed and evaluated for 13 species of secretive leaf-tailed geckos (Uroplatus spp.) that are endemic to Madagascar, for which available sample sizes range from 4 to 23 occurrence localities (at 1 km2 grid resolution). Predictions were based on 20 environmental data layers and were generated using two modelling approaches: a method based on the principle of maximum entropy (Maxent) and a genetic algorithm (GARP). Results We found high success rates and statistical significance in jackknife tests with sample sizes as low as five when the Maxent model was applied. Results for GARP at very low sample sizes (less than c. 10) were less good. When sample sizes were experimentally reduced for those species with the most records, variability among predictions using different combinations of localities demonstrated that models were greatly influenced by exactly which observations were included. Main conclusions We emphasize that models developed using this approach with small sample sizes should be interpreted as identifying regions that have similar environmental conditions to where the species is known to occur, and not as predicting actual limits to the range of a species. The jackknife validation approach proposed here enables assessment of the predictive ability of models built using very small sample sizes, although use of this test with larger sample sizes may lead to overoptimistic estimates of predictive power. Our analyses demonstrate that geographical predictions developed from small numbers of occurrence records may be of great value, for example in targeting field surveys to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations and species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearson","given":"Richard G."},{"family":"Raxworthy","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"A.

  {"id":"PetitpierreEtAl_2016","abstract":"Mountain ecosystems have been less adversely affected by invasions of nonnative plants than most other ecosystems, partially because most invasive plants in the lowlands are limited by climate and cannot grow under harsher high-elevation conditions. However, with ongoing climate change, invasive species may rapidly move upwards and threaten mid-, and then high-elevation mountain ecosystems. We evaluated this threat by modeling the current and future habitat suitability for 48 invasive plant species in Switzerland and New South Wales, Australia. Both regions had contrasting climate interactions with elevation, resulting in possible different responses of species distributions to climate change. Using a species distribution modeling approach that combines data from two spatial scales, we built high-resolution species distribution models (≤250 m) that account for the global climatic niche of species and also finer variables depicting local climate and disturbances. We found that different environmental drivers limit the elevation range of invasive species in each of the two regions, leading to region-specific species responses to climate change. The optimal suitability for plant invaders is predicted to markedly shift from the lowland to the montane or subalpine zone in Switzerland, whereas the upward shift is far less pronounced in New South Wales where montane and subalpine elevations are already suitable. The results suggest that species most likely to invade high elevations in Switzerland will be cold-tolerant, whereas species with an affinity to moist soils are most likely to invade higher elevations in Australia. Other plant traits were only marginally associated with elevation limits. These results demonstrate that a more systematic consideration of future distributions of invasive species is required in conservation plans of not yet invaded mountainous ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Petitpierre","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"McDougall","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Seipel","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Broennimann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Kueffer","given":"Christoph"}],"container-title":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1890/14-1871","ISSN":"1939-5582","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/14-1871","page":"530-544","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Will climate change increase the risk of plant invasions into mountains?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/14-1871","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"PetitpierreEtAl_2017","abstract":"Aim Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to predict impacts of global change on biodiversity, but the reliability of these predictions in space and time depends on their transferability. We tested how the strategy used to choose predictors impacts the transferability of SDMs at a cross-continental scale. Location North America, Eurasia and Australia. Method We used a systematic approach including 50 Holarctic plant invaders and 27 initial predictor variables, considering 10 different strategies for variable selection, accounting for the proximality, multicollinearity and climate analogy of predictors. We compared the average performance of each strategy, some of which used a large number of predictor combinations. Next, we looked for the single best model for each species across all the predictor combinations retained in the analysis. Transferability was considered as the predictive success of SDMs calibrated in the native range and projected onto the invaded range. Results Two strategies showed better SDM transferability on average: a set of predictors known for their ecologically meaningful effects on plant distribution, and the two first axes of a principal component analysis calibrated on all predictor variables (Spc2). From the more than 2000 combinations of predictors per species across strategies, the best set of predictors yielded SDMs with good transferability for 45 species (90%). These best combinations consisted of eight randomly assembled (39 species) or uncorrelated predictors (6 species) and Spc2 (5 species). We also found that internal cross-validation was not sufficient to give full information about the transferability of a SDM to a distinct range. Main conclusion Transferring SDMs at the macroclimatic scale, and thus anticipating invasions, is possible for the large majority of invasive plants considered in this study, but the accuracy of the predictions relies strongly on the choice of predictors. From our results, we recommend including either proximal and state-of-the-art variables or a reduced and orthogonalized set to obtain robust SDM projections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Petitpierre","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"Broennimann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Kueffer","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Daehler","given":"Curtis"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"}],"container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/geb.12530","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.12530","page":"275-287","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Selecting predictors to maximize the transferability of species distribution models: lessons from cross-continental plant invasions","title-short":"Selecting predictors to maximize the transferability of species distribution models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12530","volume":"26"},

It contains small functional changes, most notably use of a complementary log-log (cloglog) transform to produce an estimate of occurrence probability. The cloglog transform derives from the recently-published interpretation of Maxent as an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP), giving it a stronger theoretical justification than the logistic transform which it replaces by default. In addition, the new R package, maxnet, fits Maxent models using the glmnet package for regularized generalized linear models. We discuss the implications of the IPP formulation in terms of model inputs and outputs, treating occurrence records as points rather than grid cells and interpreting the exponential Maxent model (raw output) as as an estimate of relative abundance.

  {"id":"PirononEtAl_2017","abstract":"The ‘centre–periphery hypothesis’ (CPH) is a long-standing postulate in ecology that states that genetic variation and demographic performance of a species decrease from the centre to the edge of its geographic range. This hypothesis is based on an assumed concordance between geographical peripherality and ecological marginality such that environmental conditions become harsher towards the limits of a species range. In this way, the CPH sets the stage for understanding the causes of distribution limits. To date, no study has examined conjointly the consistency of these postulates. In an extensive literature review we discuss the birth and development of the CPH and provide an assessment of the CPH by reviewing 248 empirical studies in the context of three main themes. First, a decrease in species occurrence towards their range limits was observed in 81% of studies, while only 51% demonstrated reduced abundance of individuals. A decline in genetic variation, increased differentiation among populations and higher rates of inbreeding were demonstrated by roughly one in two studies (47, 45 and 48%, respectively). However, demographic rates, size and population performance less often followed CPH expectations (20–30% of studies). We highlight the impact of important methodological, taxonomic, and biogeographical biases on such validation rates. Second, we found that geographic and ecological marginality gradients are not systematically concordant, which casts doubt on the reliability of a main assumption of the CPH. Finally, we attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of geographical, ecological and historical processes on the spatial distribution of genetic and demographic parameters. While ecological marginality gradients explain variation in species' demographic performance better than geographic gradients, contemporary and historical factors may contribute interactively to spatial patterns of genetic variation. We thereby propose a framework that integrates species' ecological niche characteristics together with current and past range structure to investigate spatial patterns of genetic and demographic variation across species ranges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Pironon","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Papuga","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Villellas","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"Angert","given":"Amy L."},{"family":"García","given":"María B."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"John D."}],"container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12313","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12313","page":"1877-1909","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Geographic variation in genetic and demographic performance: new insights from an old biogeographical paradigm","title-short":"Geographic variation in genetic and demographic performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12313","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"PollockEtAl_2014","abstract":"A primary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Two major strands of ecology – habitat modelling and community ecology – approach this problem differently. Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species’ and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these distinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence. We provide a general description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were not fully described by the environmental variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assemblages despite having similar environmental affinities. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a major limitation of modelling species distributions independently.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Pollock","given":"Laura J."},{"family":"Tingley","given":"Reid"},{"family":"Morris","given":"William K."},{"family":"Golding","given":"Nick"},{"family":"O'Hara","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Parris","given":"Kirsten M."},{"family":"Vesk","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Michael A."}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12180","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12180","page":"397-406","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Understanding co-occurrence by modelling species simultaneously with a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12180","volume":"5"},

Methods We partitioned data into calibration and evaluation datasets via three variations of k-fold cross-validation: randomly partitioned, geographically structured and masked geographically structured (which restricts background data to regions corresponding to calibration localities).

Finally, we gauged performance by quantifying discriminatory ability and overfitting, as well as via visual inspections of maps of the predictions in geography. Results Performance varied among data-partitioning approaches and among regularization multipliers. The randomly partitioned approach inflated estimates of model performance and the geographically structured approach showed high overfitting. In contrast, the masked geographically structured approach allowed selection of high-performing models based on all criteria. Discriminatory ability showed a slight peak in performance around the default regularization multiplier. However, regularization levels two to four times higher than the default yielded substantially lower overfitting. Visual inspection of maps of model predictions coincided with the quantitative evaluations. Main conclusions Species-specific tuning of model parameters can improve the performance of Maxent models. Further, accurate estimates of model performance and overfitting depend on using independent evaluation data. These strategies for model evaluation may be useful for other modelling methods as well.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Radosavljevic","given":"Aleksandar"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Robert P."}],"container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/jbi.12227","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jbi.12227","page":"629-643","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Making better Maxent models of species distributions: complexity, overfitting and evaluation","title-short":"Making better Maxent models of species distributions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12227","volume":"41"},

Here we integrate genomic and ecological modeling approaches to identify genetic adaptations associated with climate in two cryptic forest bats. We then incorporate this information directly into forecasts of range changes under future climate change and assessment of population persistence through the spread of climate-adaptive genetic variation (evolutionary rescue potential). Considering climate-adaptive potential reduced range loss projections, suggesting that failure to account for intraspecific variability can result in overestimation of future losses. On the other hand, range overlap between species was projected to increase, indicating that interspecific competition is likely to play an important role in limiting species’ future ranges. We show that although evolutionary rescue is possible, it depends on a population’s adaptive capacity and connectivity. Hence, we stress the importance of incorporating genomic data and landscape connectivity in climate change vulnerability assessments and conservation management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Razgour","given":"Orly"},{"family":"Forester","given":"Brenna"},{"family":"Taggart","given":"John B."},{"family":"Bekaert","given":"Michaël"},{"family":"Juste","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Ibáñez","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Puechmaille","given":"Sébastien J."},{"family":"Novella-Fernandez","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Alberdi","given":"Antton"},{"family":"Manel","given":"Stéphanie"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1820663116","ISBN":"9781820663118","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"language":"en","page":"10418-10423","PMID":"31061126","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Considering adaptive genetic variation in climate change vulnerability assessment reduces species range loss projections","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10418","volume":"116"},

  {"id":"Rodriguez-ReyEtAl_2013","abstract":"The evaluation of species distribution models (SDMs) is a crucial step; usually, a random subsample of data is used to test prediction capacity. This procedure, called cross-validation, has been recently shown to overestimate SDMs performance due to spatial autocorrelation. In the case of expanding species, there exists the possibility to test the predictions with non-random geographically structured data, i.e., a new data set which corresponds to the last occupied localities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of SDMs to predict the range expansion pattern of six free-living deer species in Great Britain and to assess whether SDMs perform better than a simple dispersal model – a null model that assumes no environmental control in the expansion process. Distribution data for the species prior to 1972 were used to train the SDMs (ENFA, MAXENT, logistic regression and an ensemble model) in order to obtain suitability maps. Additionally, the geographical distance to the localities occupied in 1972 was considered a proxy of the probability that a certain locality has to be occupied during an expansion process considering only dispersal (GD model). Subsequently, we analysed whether the species increased their ranges between 1972 and 2006 according to the estimated suitability patterns and whether or not SDMs predictions outperformed GD predictions. SDMs showed a high discrimination capacity in the training data, with the ensemble models performing the best and ENFA models the worst. SDMs predictions also worked better than chance in classifying new occupied localities, although differences among techniques disappeared and the predictions showed no difference with respect to GD. Spatial autocorrelation of both the environmental predictors and the expansion process may explain these results which illustrate that GD is a much more parsimonious model than any of the SDMs and may thus be preferable both for prediction and explanation. Overestimation of SDMs performance and usefulness may be a common fact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodríguez-Rey","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Jiménez-Valverde","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Acevedo","given":"Pelayo"}],"container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.01.024","ISSN":"0304-3800","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1-5","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Species distribution models predict range expansion better than chance but not better than a simple dispersal model","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380013000914","volume":"256"},

Fortunately, tools for identifying and accommodating potentially confounding spatial or temporal trends are available, and new methods are being rapidly developed.

  {"id":"RoubicekEtAl_2010","abstract":"Ecological niche models (ENMs) have multiple applications in ecology, evolution and conservation planning. They relate the known locations of a species to characteristics of its environment (usually climate) over its geographical range. Most ENMs are trained using standard 30-year (1961–1990) or 50-year (1951–2000) baselines to represent current climate conditions. Species occurrence records used as input to the models, however, are frequently collected from time periods that differ from those from which the climate is derived. Since climate variability can be significant within and outside baselines, and the distributions of some plants and animals (e.g., annual plants, insects) can adjust to environmental conditions on much shorter time scales, this mismatch between collection records and climatic baselines may affect the utility and accuracy of model outputs. We investigated how the choice of baseline periods influenced modelling efforts, anticipating that climate baselines derived from the same temporal period as the species records would yield improved ENMs. Ten simulated species’ distributions were modelled using an ENM (Maxent) for (a) occurrences and climates within the same temporal period, based on eighteen 10-year baselines within the 20th century and (b) all available samples and climate baselines from 1951–2000 and 1961–1990. Each model was projected onto all the available 10-year climate scenarios and compared to the models trained on the corresponding scenario. We show that temporal mismatches of species occurrences and climate baselines can result in significantly poorer distribution models. Such temporal mismatch may be unavoidable for many studies, but we emphasize here the need to match the time range of samples and climate data whenever possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Roubicek","given":"A.

Peripheral areas are characterized by variable and unstable conditions, relative to core areas. Peripheral populations are expected to be genetically more variable, since the variable conditions induce fluctuating selection, which maintains high genetic diversity. Alternatively, due to marginal ecological conditions at the periphery, populations there are small and isolated; the within-population diversity is low, but the between-population genetic diversity is high due to genetic drift. It is also likely that peripheral populations evolve resistance to extreme conditions. Thus, peripheral populations rather than core ones may be resistant to environmental extremes and changes, such as global climate change induced by the anthropogenically emitted “greenhouse gases”. They should be treated as a biogenetic resource used for rehabilitation and restoration of damaged ecosystems. Climatic transition zones are characterized by a high incidence of species represented by peripheral populations, and therefore should be conserved now as repositories of these resources, to be used in the future for mitigating undesirable effects of global climate change.

We applied three emerging techniques for recreating past population dynamics—high resolution aerial photography time series, stem growth ring analysis and population level field surveys—to recreate the introduction and invasion history for bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata) in Western Australia. We also compared across dating techniques to test the validity of using stem rings produced by successive cambia for dating purposes, and analysed for the influence of ontogenetic, environmental and morphological factors on stem ring formation. Aerial photography allowed for an accurate recreation of plant presence over time and individual plant age for 18 plants. In a sample of over 500 plants with up to 42 rings, canopy area was related to plant age and ring number, while stem diameter was related to canopy size and ring number. However, stem rings were not produced in a temporally consistent manner and could not be predicted reliably. Up to eight stem rings were produced in younger plants, for which the rate of ring production was greatest. While there was an ontogenetic growth pattern for ring width, no inter-plant synchronisation of ring size was detected, as would be expected if ring size were a response to landscape level climate factors. With aerial imagery and stem ring analysis providing new ways to recreate plant population dynamics at the individual plant level, managers can use this insight to refine conservation and invasion management programs.

  {"id":"SextonEtAl_2014","abstract":"Gene flow among populations can enhance local adaptation if it introduces new genetic variants available for selection, but strong gene flow can also stall adaptation by swamping locally beneficial genes. These outcomes can depend on population size, genetic variation, and the environmental context. Gene flow patterns may align with geographic distance (IBD—isolation by distance), whereby immigration rates are inversely proportional to the distance between populations. Alternatively gene flow may follow patterns of isolation by environment (IBE), whereby gene flow rates are higher among similar environments. Finally, gene flow may be highest among dissimilar environments (counter-gradient gene flow), the classic “gene-swamping” scenario. Here we survey relevant studies to determine the prevalence of each pattern across environmental gradients. Of 70 studies, we found evidence of IBD in 20.0%, IBE in 37.1%, and both patterns in 37.1%. In addition, 10.0% of studies exhibited counter-gradient gene flow. In total, 74.3% showed significant IBE patterns. This predominant IBE pattern of gene flow may have arisen directly through natural selection or reflect other adaptive and nonadaptive processes leading to nonrandom gene flow.

  {"id":"SextonEtAl_2016","abstract":"Gene flow may influence the formation of species range limits, and yet little is known about the patterns of gene flow with respect to environmental gradients or proximity to range limits. With rapid environmental change, it is especially important to understand patterns of gene flow to inform conservation efforts. Here we investigate the species range of the selfing, annual plant, Mimulus laciniatus, in the California Sierra Nevada. We assessed genetic variation, gene flow, and population abundance across the entire elevation-based climate range. Contrary to expectations, within-population plant density increased towards both climate limits. Mean genetic diversity of edge populations was equivalent to central populations; however, all edge populations exhibited less genetic diversity than neighbouring interior populations. Genetic differentiation was fairly consistent and moderate among all populations, and no directional signals of contemporary gene flow were detected between central and peripheral elevations. Elevation-driven gene flow (isolation by environment), but not isolation by distance, was found across the species range. These findings were the same towards high- and low-elevation range limits and were inconsistent with two common centre-edge hypotheses invoked for the formation of species range limits: (i) decreasing habitat quality and population size; (ii) swamping gene flow from large, central populations. This pattern demonstrates that climate, but not centre-edge dynamics, is an important range-wide factor structuring M. laciniatus populations. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to relate environmental patterns of gene flow to range limits hypotheses. Similar investigations across a wide variety of taxa and life histories are needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sexton","given":"Jason P."},{"family":"Hufford","given":"Matthew B."},{"family":"C.Bateman","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Lowry","given":"David B."},{"family":"Meimberg","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Strauss","given":"Sharon Y."},{"family":"Rice","given":"Kevin J."}],"container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.13528","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.13528","page":"911-928","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Climate structures genetic variation across a species' elevation range: a test of range limits hypotheses","title-short":"Climate structures genetic variation across a species' elevation range","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13528","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"Soberon_2010","abstract":"Statistical modeling of areas of distribution of species by correlative analysis of the environmental features of known presences has become widespread. However, to a large degree, the logic and the functioning of many of these applications remain obscure, not only due to the fact that some of the modeling methods are intrinsically complex (neural networks, genetic algorithms, generalized additive models, for example), but mainly because the role of other ecological processes affecting the species distributions sometimes is not explicitly stated. Resorting to fundamental principles of population ecology, a scheme of analysis based on separation of three factors affecting species distributions (environment, biotic interactions and movements) is used to clarify some results of niche modeling exercises. The area of distribution of a virtual species which was generated by both environmental and biotic factors serves to illustrate the possibility that, at coarse resolutions, the distribution can be approximately recovered using only information about the environmental factors and ignoring the biotic interactions. Finally, information on the distribution of a butterfly species, Baronia brevicornis, is used to illustrate the importance of interpreting the results of niche models by including hypothesis about one class of movements. The results clarify the roles of the three factors in interpreting the results of using correlative approaches to modeling species distributions or their niches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Soberón","given":"Jorge M."}],"container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06074.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06074.x","page":"159-167","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Niche and area of distribution modeling: a population ecology perspective","title-short":"Niche and area of distribution modeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06074.x","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"SoltisEtAl_2006","abstract":"Regional phylogeographical studies involving co-distributed animal and plant species have been conducted for several areas, most notably for Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America. Until recently, phylogeographical studies in unglaciated eastern North America have been largely limited to animals. As more studies emerge for diverse lineages (including plants), it seems timely to assess the phylogeography across this region: (i) comparing and contrasting the patterns seen in plants and animals; (ii) assessing the extent of pseudocongruence; and (iii) discussing the potential applications of regional phylogeography to issues in ecology, such as response to climatic change. Unglaciated eastern North America is a large, geologically and topographically complex area with the species examined having diverse distributions. Nonetheless, some recurrent patterns emerge: (i) maritime — Atlantic vs. Gulf Coast; (ii) Apalachicola River discontinuity; (iii) Tombigbee River discontinuity; (iv) the Appalachian Mountain discontinuity; (v) the Mississippi River discontinuity; and (vi) the Apalachicola River and Mississippi River discontinuities. Although initially documented in animals, most of these patterns are also apparent in plants, providing support for phylogeographical generalizations. These patterns may generally be attributable to isolation and differentiation during Pleistocene glaciation, but in some cases may be older (Pliocene). Molecular studies sometimes agree with longstanding hypotheses of glacial refugia, but also suggest additional possible refugia, such as the southern Appalachian Mountains and areas close to the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Many species exhibit distinct patterns that reflect the unique, rather than the shared, aspects of species’ phylogeographical histories. Furthermore, similar modern phylogeographical patterns can result from different underlying causal factors operating at different times (i.e. pseudocongruence). One underemphasized component of pseudocongruence may result from the efforts of researchers to categorize patterns visually — similar patterns may, in fact, not fully coincide, and inferring agreement may obscure the actual patterns and lead to erroneous conclusions. Our modelling analyses indicate no clear spatial patterning and support the hypothesis that phylogeographical structure in diverse temperate taxa is complex and was not shaped by just a few barriers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Soltis","given":"Douglas E."},{"family":"Morris","given":"Ashley B."},{"family":"McLACHLAN","given":"Jason S."},{"family":"Manos","given":"Paul S."},{"family":"Soltis","given":"Pamela S."}],"container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03061.x","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03061.x","page":"4261-4293","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Comparative phylogeography of unglaciated eastern North America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03061.x","volume":"15"},

We use composite species distribution modelling to identify suitable habitats for 18 members of the North American Atlantic Coastal Plain Flora (ACPF) since the Last Glacial Maximum and project these into the future. We then use Scirpus longii (Cyperaceae), a globally imperiled ACPF sedge with many of the characteristics of extinction vulnerability, as a case study. We integrate phylogeographical and population genetic analyses and species distribution modelling to develop a broad view of its current condition and prognosis for conservation. We use genotyping-by-sequencing to characterize the genomes of 142 S. longii individuals from 20 populations distributed throughout its range (New Jersey to Nova Scotia). We measure the distribution of genetic diversity in the species and reconstruct its phylogeographical history using the snapp and rase models. Extant populations of S. longii originated from a single refugium south of the Laurentide ice sheet around 25 ka. The genetic diversity of S. longii is exceedingly low, populations exhibit little genetic structure and the species is slightly inbred. Projected climate scenarios indicate that nearly half of extant populations of S. longii will be exposed to unsuitable climate by 2070. Similar changes in suitable habitat will occur for many other northern ACPF species—centres of diversity will shift northward and Nova Scotia may become the last refuges for those species not extinguished.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Spalink","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"MacKay","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Sytsma","given":"Kenneth J."}],"container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.15006","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.15006","page":"2046-2061","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Phylogeography, population genetics and distribution modelling reveal vulnerability of Scirpus longii (Cyperaceae) and the Atlantic Coastal Plain Flora to climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.15006","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"VaclavikMeentemeyer_2012","abstract":"Aim The assumption of equilibrium between organisms and their environment is a standard working postulate in species distribution models (SDMs). However, this assumption is typically violated in models of biological invasions where range expansions are highly constrained by dispersal and colonization processes. Here, we examined how stage of invasion affects the extent to which occurrence data represent the ecological niche of organisms and, in turn, influences spatial prediction of species’ potential distributions. Location Six ecoregions in western Oregon, USA. Methods We compiled occurrence data from 697 field plots collected over a 9-year period (2001–09) of monitoring the spread of invasive forest pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. Using these data, we applied ecological-niche factor analysis to calibrate models of potential distribution across different years of colonization. We accounted for natural variation and uncertainties in model evaluation by further investigating three hypothetical scenarios of varying equilibrium in a simulated virtual species, for which the ‘true’ potential distribution was known. Results We confirm our hypothesis that SDMs calibrated in early stages of invasion are less accurate than models calibrated under scenarios closer to equilibrium. SDMs that are developed in early stages of invasion tend to underpredict the potential range compared to models that are built in later stages of invasion. Main conclusions A full environmental niche of invasive species cannot be effectively captured with data from a realized distribution that is restricted by processes preventing full occupancy of suitable habitats. If SDMs are to be used effectively in conservation and management, stage of invasion needs to be considered to avoid underestimation of habitats at risk of invasion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Václavík","given":"Tomáš"},{"family":"Meentemeyer","given":"Ross K."}],"container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00854.x","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00854.x","page":"73-83","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Equilibrium or not?

  {"id":"VanbrabantEtAl_2020","abstract":"High quality fruit production requires the regulation of the crop load on fruit trees by reducing the number of flowers and fruitlets early in the growing season, if the bearing is too high. Several automated flower cluster quantification methods based on proximal and remote imagery methods have been proposed to estimate flower cluster numbers, but their overall performance is still far from satisfactory. For other methods, the performance of the method to estimate flower clusters within a tree is unknown since they were only tested on images from one perspective. One of the main reported bottlenecks is the presence of occluded flowers due to limitations of the top-view perspective of the platform-sensor combinations. In order to tackle this problem, the multi-view perspective from the Red–Green–Blue (RGB) colored dense point clouds retrieved from drone imagery are compared and evaluated against the field-based flower cluster number per tree. Experimental results obtained on a dataset of two pear tree orchards (N = 144) demonstrate that our 3D object-based method, a combination of pixel-based classification with the stochastic gradient boosting algorithm and density-based clustering (DBSCAN), significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in flower cluster estimations from the 2D top-view (R2 = 0.53), with R2 &gt; 0.7 and RRMSE &lt; 15%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Vanbrabant","given":"Yasmin"},{"family":"Delalieux","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Tits","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Pauly","given":"Klaas"},{"family":"Vandermaesen","given":"Joke"},{"family":"Somers","given":"Ben"}],"container-title":"Agronomy","DOI":"10.3390/agronomy10030407","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3]]},"language":"en","number":"3","page":"407","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Pear Flower Cluster Quantification Using RGB Drone Imagery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/3/407","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"VincetiEtAl_2013","abstract":"Conservation priorities for Prunus africana, a tree species found across Afromontane regions, which is of great commercial interest internationally and of local value for rural communities, were defined with the aid of spatial analyses applied to a set of georeferenced molecular marker data (chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites) from 32 populations in 9 African countries. Two approaches for the selection of priority populations for conservation were used, differing in the way they optimize representation of intra-specific diversity of P. africana across a minimum number of populations. The first method (S1) was aimed at maximizing genetic diversity of the conservation units and their distinctiveness with regard to climatic conditions, the second method (S2) at optimizing representativeness of the genetic diversity found throughout the species’ range. Populations in East African countries (especially Kenya and Tanzania) were found to be of great conservation value, as suggested by previous findings. These populations are complemented by those in Madagascar and Cameroon. The combination of the two methods for prioritization led to the identification of a set of 6 priority populations. The potential distribution of P. africana was then modeled based on a dataset of 1,500 georeferenced observations. This enabled an assessment of whether the priority populations identified are exposed to threats from agricultural expansion and climate change, and whether they are located within the boundaries of protected areas. The range of the species has been affected by past climate change and the modeled distribution of P. africana indicates that the species is likely to be negatively affected in future, with an expected decrease in distribution by 2050. Based on these insights, further research at the regional and national scale is recommended, in order to strengthen P. africana conservation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Vinceti","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Loo","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Gaisberger","given":"Hannes"},{"family":"Zonneveld","given":"Maarten J.","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Schueler","given":"Silvio"},{"family":"Konrad","given":"Heino"},{"family":"Kadu","given":"Caroline A.

  {"id":"WaldenEtAl_","abstract":"Adaptation to local climatic conditions is commonly found within species, but whether it involves the same intraspecific genomic variants is unknown. We studied this question in North American Arabidopsis lyrata, whose current distribution is shaped by post-glacial range expansion from two refugia, resulting in two distinct genetic clusters covering comparable climatic gradients. Using pooled whole-genome sequence data of 41 outcrossing populations, we identified loci associated with three niche-determining climatic variables in the two clusters and compared these outliers. Little evidence was found for parallelism in climate adaptation for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and for genes with an accumulation of outlier SNPs. Significantly increased selection coefficients supported them as candidates of climate adaptation. However, the fraction of gene ontology (GO) terms shared between clusters was higher compared to outlier SNPs and outlier genes, suggesting that selection acts on similar pathways but not necessarily the same genes. Enriched GO terms involved responses to abiotic and biotic stress, circadian rhythm and development, with flower development and reproduction being among the most frequently detected.

  {"id":"WarrenEtAl_2008","abstract":"Environmental niche models, which are generated by combining species occurrence data with environmental GIS data layers, are increasingly used to answer fundamental questions about niche evolution, speciation, and the accumulation of ecological diversity within clades. The question of whether environmental niches are conserved over evolutionary time scales has attracted considerable attention, but often produced conflicting conclusions. This conflict, however, may result from differences in how niche similarity is measured and the specific null hypothesis being tested. We develop new methods for quantifying niche overlap that rely on a traditional ecological measure and a metric from mathematical statistics. We reexamine a classic study of niche conservatism between sister species in several groups of Mexican animals, and, for the first time, address alternative definitions of “niche conservatism” within a single framework using consistent methods. As expected, we find that environmental niches of sister species are more similar than expected under three distinct null hypotheses, but that they are rarely identical. We demonstrate how our measures can be used in phylogenetic comparative analyses by reexamining niche divergence in an adaptive radiation of Cuban anoles. Our results show that environmental niche overlap is closely tied to geographic overlap, but not to phylogenetic distances, suggesting that niche conservatism has not constrained local communities in this group to consist of closely related species. We suggest various randomization tests that may prove useful in other areas of ecology and evolutionary biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Warren","given":"Dan L."},{"family":"Glor","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Turelli","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x","page":"2868-2883","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Environmental Niche Equivalency Versus Conservatism: Quantitative Approaches to Niche Evolution","title-short":"Environmental Niche Equivalency Versus Conservatism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x","volume":"62"},

ENMTools was initially implemented as a Perl script, which was also compiled into an executable file for various platforms. However, the package had a number of significant limitations; it was only designed to fit models using Maxent, it relied on a specific Perl distribution to function, and its internal structure made it difficult to maintain and expand. Subsequently, the R programming language became the platform of choice for most ENM studies, making ENMTools less usable for many practitioners. Here we introduce a new R version of ENMTools that implements much of the functionality of its predecessor as well as numerous additions that simplify the construction, comparison and evaluation of niche models. These additions include new metrics for model fit, methods of measuring ENM overlap, and methods for testing evolutionary hypotheses. The new version of ENMTools is also designed to work within the expanding universe of R tools for ecological biogeography, and as such includes greatly simplified interfaces for analyses from several other R packages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Warren","given":"Dan L."},{"family":"Matzke","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Cardillo","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"John B."},{"family":"Beaumont","given":"Linda J."},{"family":"Turelli","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Glor","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Huron","given":"Nicholas A."},{"family":"Simões","given":"Marianna"},{"family":"Iglesias","given":"Teresa L."},{"family":"Piquet","given":"Julien C."},{"family":"Dinnage","given":"Russell"}],"container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.05485","ISSN":"1600-0587","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecog.05485","page":"1-8","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"ENMTools 1.0: an R package for comparative ecological biogeography","title-short":"ENMTools 1.0","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.05485","volume":"44"},

Model complexity is typically constrained via a process known as L1 regularization, but at present little guidance is available for setting the appropriate level of regularization, and the effects of inappropriately complex or simple models are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate the use of information criterion approaches to setting regularization in Maxent, and we compare models selected using information criteria to models selected using other criteria that are common in the literature. We evaluate model performance using occurrence data generated from a known “true” initial Maxent model, using several different metrics for model quality and transferability. We demonstrate that models that are inappropriately complex or inappropriately simple show reduced ability to infer habitat quality, reduced ability to infer the relative importance of variables in constraining species' distributions, and reduced transferability to other time periods.

  {"id":"Waterway_1990","abstract":"Patterns of variation within and between Carex gynodynama and C. mendocinensis were investigated by studying allozyme and chromosome variation in natural populations and structural variation using herbarium specimens. Multivariate analyses of structural data demonstrated that C. gynodynama is clearly distinct from C. mendocinensis, and that sterile specimens similar to C. mendocinensis are intermediate between that species and C. gynodynama. The mean genetic distance between the two species, based on allozyme phenotypes at 17 enzyme-coding loci, was 0.22 ± 0.12. The sterile putative hybrids had the expected heterozygous pattern at three enzyme-coding loci at which the parental species were fixed for different alleles. Chromosome numbers are reported for the first time for both species and their putative hybrid. Carex mendocinensis had a different number in each of the three populations examined with n = 28, n = 29, or n = 30. Chromosome counts from one population of C. gynodynama revealed five plants with n = 25 and one with n = 26. Putative hybrids from this population exhibited irregular pairing at meiosis with 2n = ca. 55–57. Patterns of allozyme variation also suggest that C. mendocinensis has an outcrossing or mixed mating system but that C. gynodynama is an inbreeding species. Carex gynodynama exhibited very little variation in structure, habitat, or at the enzyme-coding loci examined, suggesting that it may have experienced a genetic bottleneck relatively recently. Carex mendocinensis had higher levels of variation both within and between populations at enzyme-coding loci and in structural features. This pattern of variation and a geographic distribution centered in serpentine areas of the Klamath–Siskiyou region, with disjunct smaller populations in serpentine areas farther south, suggest that C. mendocinensis once may have been a more widespread species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Waterway","given":"Marcia J."}],"container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.1002/j.1537-2197.1990.tb14471.x","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.1537-2197.1990.tb14471.x","page":"826-838","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Genetic differentiation and hybridization between <i>Carex gynodynama</i> and <i>C. mendocinensis</i> (Cyperaceae) in California","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1537-2197.1990.tb14471.x","volume":"77"},
  {"id":"WatsonEtAl_2020","abstract":"Intensive management of urban lawns is globally widespread, predominantly for aesthetic reasons. However, a growing body of knowledge demonstrates negative ecological and environmental effects of this practice. We present a meta-analysis of North American and European studies from 2004 to 2019, which incorporates three previously unpublished datasets from eastern Canada, to investigate how mowing intensity impacts the ecology of urban lawns. The meta-analysis provides aggregated evidence that invertebrate and plant diversity is lower in urban lawns under increased mowing intensity. This decline is independent of the level of contrast between mowing ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ (e.g. height or frequency of mowing), which differed considerably between studies. Intensive mowing also increases the occurrence of pest species (e.g. herbivorous beetle larvae and allergenic plants), though studies in this group were limited to northern environments. Changes in ecosystem-level variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit and carbon deficit) were less evident and suggest changes in abiotic processes may take longer to become apparent. An economic case study of the mowing costs in Trois-Rivières, Canada, suggests that cost savings of 36% may be possible with a modest reduction of mowing frequency. Synthesis and Applications. Increasing urban biodiversity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strong motivators for reducing lawn management intensity. We also suggest that the benefits of reducing pest species while saving lawn management costs may provide additional social and economic incentives for decision makers to review urban greenspace management practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Watson","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Carignan‐Guillemette","given":"Léonie"},{"family":"Turcotte","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Maire","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Proulx","given":"Raphaël"}],"container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.13542","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.13542","page":"436-446","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ecological and economic benefits of low-intensity urban lawn management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.13542","volume":"57"},

In this article, we outline a guide to tackling distribution limits that integrates established causes, such as dispersal limitation and spatial environmental heterogeneity, with understudied causes, such as mutational load and genetic or developmental integration of traits limiting niche expansion. We highlight how modeling and quantitative genetic and genomic analyses can provide insight into sources of distribution limits.

  {"id":"WiszEtAl_2013","abstract":"Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km2 to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary and palaeoecological studies of individual species ranges, functional groups, and species richness patterns, we show that biotic interactions have clearly left their mark on species distributions and realised assemblages of species across all spatial extents. We demonstrate this with examples from within and across trophic groups. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wisz","given":"Mary Susanne"},{"family":"Pottier","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Kissling","given":"W.

Finally, some examples are given.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Worton","given":"Bruce J."}],"container-title":"Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation","DOI":"10.1080/00949658908811152","ISSN":"0094-9655","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1989,5,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00949658908811152","page":"45-57","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Optimal smoothing parameters for multivariate fized and adaptive kernel methods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00949658908811152","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"Worton_1995","abstract":"Kernel density estimators have been used to estimate home range size but little is known of their statistical properties. I applied kernel-based estimators of home range size, calculated from 95% probability contours of nonparametric density estimators, to computer-simulated radiolocation data. Four hypothetical models of home range suggested by Boulanger and White (1990) were used to evaluate bias and precision of these estimators in estimating known home range sizes. Kernel methods compared well with the best methods that are available for home range size estimation provided the appropriate level of smoothing was selected. I used brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani) telemetry data to illustrate how Monte Carlo methods may also be used to assess estimator performance from field radiolocation data. A kernel estimator is preferred to a harmonic mean estimator in this example because it is less biased (i.e., the harmonic mean method has an inherent problem).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Worton","given":"Bruce J."}],"container-title":"The Journal of Wildlife Management","DOI":"10.2307/3801959","ISSN":"0022-541X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"page":"794-800","publisher":"[Wiley, Wildlife Society]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Using Monte Carlo Simulation to Evaluate Kernel-Based Home Range Estimators","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3801959","volume":"59"},
  {"id":"YakimowskiEckert_2007","abstract":"Abstract: Geographically peripheral populations of widespread species are often the focus of conservation because they are locally rare within political jurisdictions. Yet the ecology and genetics of these populations are rarely evaluated in a broader geographic context. Most expectations concerning the ecology and evolution of peripheral populations derive from the abundant-center model, which predicts that peripheral populations should be less frequent, smaller, less dense, and have a lower reproductive rate than central populations. We tested these predictions and in doing so evaluated the conservation value of peripheral populations for the clonal shrub Vaccinium stamineum L. (Ericaceae, deerberry), which is listed as threatened in Canada. Based on 51 populations sampled from the center to the northern range limits over 2 years, population frequency and size declined toward the range limit, but ramet density increased. Sexual reproductive output varied widely among populations and between years, with many populations producing very few seeds, but did not decline toward range margins. In fact seed mass increased steadily toward range limit, and this was associated with faster germination and seedling growth, which may be adaptive in seasonal northern environments. Our results did not support the prediction that clonal reproduction is more prevalent in peripheral populations or that it contributed antagonistically to the wide variation in seed production. Peripheral populations of V. stamineum are as productive as central populations and may be locally adapted to northern environments. This emphasizes the importance of a broad geographical perspective for evaluating the ecology, evolution, and conservation of peripheral populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Yakimowski","given":"Sarah B."},{"family":"Eckert","given":"Christopher G."}],"container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00684.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00684.x","page":"811-822","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Threatened peripheral populations in context: geographical variation in population frequency and size and sexual reproduction in a clonal woody shrub","title-short":"Threatened Peripheral Populations in Context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00684.x","volume":"21"},
