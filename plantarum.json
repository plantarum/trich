  {"id":"AdamackGruber_2014","abstract":"Using scripting languages such as R to perform population genetic analyses can improve the reproducibility of research, but using R can be challenging for many researchers due to its steep learning curve. PopGenReport is a new R package that simplifies performing population genetics analyses in R, through the use of a new report-generating function. The function popgenreport allows users to perform up to 13 pre-defined and 1 user-defined analyses through the use of a single command line. Each analysis generates figures and tables that are incorporated into a pdf report and are also made available as individual files (figures are provided in multiple formats, table contents are provided as csv files). The package includes new R functions that simplify the importation of data from a spreadsheet file, examine allele distributions across populations and loci and identify private alleles, determine pairwise individual genetic distances using the methods of Smouse and Peakall () and Kosman and Leonard (), respectively, detect the presence of null alleles, calculate allelic richness, and test for spatial autocorrelation in genotypes using the methods of Smouse and Peakall (). The package has a modular structure that makes the process of adding new functionality straightforward. To facilitate the addition of user-designed functions, the package includes a fully customizable module that can be automatically included in the pdf report. To support users not experienced in R, the website (www.popgenreport.org) has a tutorial for the package and a downloadable, portable version of the package with LaTeX pre-configured for the Windows operating system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Adamack","given":"Aaron T."},{"family":"Gruber","given":"Bernd"}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12158","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12158","page":"384-387","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"PopGenReport: simplifying basic population genetic analyses in R","title-short":"PopGenReport","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12158","volume":"5"},

Conservation and the Genetics of Populations gives a comprehensive overview of the essential background, concepts, and tools needed to understand how genetic information can be used to conserve species threatened with extinction, and to manage species of ecological or commercial importance. New molecular techniques, statistical methods, and computer programs, genetic principles, and methods are becoming increasingly useful in the conservation of biological diversity. Using a balance of data and theory, coupled with basic and applied research examples, this book examines genetic and phenotypic variation in natural populations, the principles and mechanisms of evolutionary change, the interpretation of genetic data from natural populations, and how these can be applied to conservation. The book includes examples from plants, animals, and microbes in wild and captive populations. This second edition contains new chapters on Climate Change and Exploited Populations as well as new sections on genomics, genetic monitoring, emerging diseases, metagenomics, and more. One-third of the references in this edition were published after the first edition. Each of the 22 chapters and the statistical appendix have a Guest Box written by an expert in that particular topic (including James Crow, Louis Bernatchez, Loren Rieseberg, Rick Shine, and Lisette Waits).

  {"id":"briscoerunquist.etal_2019","abstract":"Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) is an annual plant native to the desert Southwest of the United States and Mexico and has become invasive and caused large economic losses across much of the United States. In order to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of past invasion, and to predict future invasion, we developed a broad array of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, we constructed sequential SDMs throughout the invasion history and asked how well those predicted future invasion (1970 to present). We showed that invasion occurred from a restricted set of environments in the native range to a diverse set in the invaded range. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that rapid range expansion was facilitated by stochastic, long-distance dispersal events. Regardless of SDM approach, all SDMs built using datasets from early in the invasion (1970–2010) performed poorly and failed to predict most of the current invaded range. Together, these results suggest that climate is unlikely to have influenced early stages of range expansion. SDMs that incorporated data from the most recent sampling (2011–2017) performed considerably better, predicted high suitability in regions that have recently become invaded, and identified mean annual temperature as a key factor limiting northward range expansion. Under future climates, models predicted both further northward range expansion and significantly increased suitability across large portions of the U.S. Overall, our results indicate significant challenges for SDMs of invasive species far from climate equilibrium. However, our models based on recent data make more robust predictions for northward range expansion of A. palmeri with climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Briscoe Runquist","given":"Ryan D."},{"family":"Lake","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Tiffin","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Moeller","given":"David A."}],"container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-38054-9","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,20]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"2426","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Species distribution models throughout the invasion history of Palmer amaranth predict regions at risk of future invasion and reveal challenges with modeling rapidly shifting geographic ranges","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38054-9","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"BrookEtAl_2002","abstract":"ABSTRACT. Wild populations face threats both from deterministic factors, e.g., habitat loss, overexploitation, pollution, and introduced species, and from stochastic events of a demographic, genetic, and environmental nature, including catastrophes. Inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness in naturally outbreeding species, but its role in extinctions of wild populations is controversial. To evaluate critically the role of inbreeding in extinction, we conducted realistic population viability analyses of 20 threatened species, with and without inbreeding depression, using initial population sizes of 50, 250, and 1000. Inbreeding markedly decreased median times to extinction by 28.5, 30.5, and 25% for initial populations of 50, 250, and 1000, respectively, and the impacts were similar across major taxa. The major variable explaining differences among species was initial population growth rate, whereas the impact of inbreeding was least in species with negative growth rates. These results demonstrate that the prospects for survival of threatened species will usually be seriously overestimated if genetic factors are disregarded, and that inappropriate recovery plans may be instituted if inbreeding depression is ignored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Brook","given":"Barry W."},{"family":"Tonkyn","given":"David W."},{"family":"O'Grady","given":"Julian J."},{"family":"Frankham","given":"Richard"}],"container-title":"Conservation Ecology","ISSN":"1195-5449","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"publisher":"Resilience Alliance Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"Contribution of Inbreeding to Extinction Risk in Threatened Species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26271855","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"Brown_1984","abstract":"There appears to be a general relationship between abundance and distribution that has two parts. First, within species, population density tends to be greatest in the center of the range and to decline gradually toward the boundaries. This pattern holds over a range of spatial scales from steep environmental gradients within local regions to the entire geographic range. Exceptions include: (1) abrupt changes in abundance that usually correspond to sharp, discontinuous changes in single environmental variables; and (2) multimodal patterns of abundance that are caused by environmental patchiness. The second general relationship is that among closely related, ecologically similar species spatial distribution is positively correlated with average abundance. Again this pattern holds over a variety of spatial scales from local regions to entire geographic ranges. These empirical patterns have already been reported in the literature, but their generality is demonstrated by analysis of additional data for diverse kinds of organisms. A single general theory accounts for these observations and follows logically from three assumptions. First, the abundance and distribution of each species are limited by the combination of physical and biotic environmental variables that determines the multidimensional niche. Second, spatial variation in these environmental variables is somewhat stochastic but autocorrelated, so that nearby sites tend to have more similar environmental conditions than more distant ones. Third, closely related, ecologically similar species differ in no more than a very few niche dimensions. A more formal model can be developed that predicts that under these assumptions the distribution of population density over space should approximate a normal probability density distribution. Most exceptions to this predicted pattern can be explained as cases in which assumptions of the model are clearly violated. This paper represents an example of a statistical approach that should be useful for investigating complex ecological systems comprised of many components, such as species of many individuals or communities of many species. The general relationships between abundance and distribution developed here eventually should contribute to our understanding of the biogeography, population genetics, and evolution of species as well as the ecological attributes of populations and communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"James H."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/284267","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1984,8,1]]},"page":"255-279","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"On the Relationship between Abundance and Distribution of Species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/284267","volume":"124"},

  {"id":"ChannellLomolino_2000","abstract":"As one moves from the core to the periphery of a species' geographical range, populations occupy less favourable habitats and exhibit lower and more variable densities1,2,3,4. Populations along the periphery of the range tend to be more fragmented and, as a result, are less likely to receive immigrants from other populations. A population's probability of extinction is directly correlated with its variability and inversely correlated with density and immigration rate5,6,7,8,9. This has led to the prediction that, when a species becomes endangered, its geographical range should contract inwards, with the core populations persisting until the final stages of decline2,10. Convinced by these logical but untested deductions, conservation biologists and wildlife managers have been instructed to avoid the range periphery when planning conservation strategies or allocating resources for endangered species11,12,13. We have analysed range contraction in 245 species from a broad range of taxonomic groups and geographical regions.

  {"id":"charlesricou.etal_2014","abstract":"Conservation of pollinator abundance and diversity is an important issue because it contributes to main-taining a diverse community of plant species in agroecosystems. The presence of semi-natural areasfavorable to pollination is a key factor for achieving this objective of sustainability. Sowing mixtures ofdicotyledonous plants that are rich in pollen and nectar as flower strips along field margins is an efficientsolution to attract pollinators and to support their foraging activity on arable land. The enhancement ofagroecosystems requires operational methods that make it possible to assess the impact of existing andsown semi-natural areas on pollination. We developed here a new predictive indicator that can be usedat the field margin and floral levels, which predicts the pollination value of floral diversity and abundanceof field margins on arable land.We based the predictive indicator on decision trees using “if-then” linguistic rules because of the lackof sufficient quantitative knowledge about the relationships between floral traits and pollination. Thisapproach makes it possible to use quantitative and qualitative information. We associated fuzzy subsetsto the decision trees and the classes of variables in order to avoid the knife-edge effect of class limits. Atthe species level, the indicator depends on three criteria: (i) visual attractiveness in terms of flower size,color and UV reflection; (ii) flower accessibility according to the botanical family, the symmetry and theshape of the flower; and (iii) the reward linked to pollen and nectar quantity and quality. An aggregationprocedure allows us to obtain a value at the field margin level for each month as a function of theflowering period and pollination activity. Examples of calculations for honeybees, wild bees, bumblebeesand hoverflies are shown.The evaluation of the predictive quality yielded significant correlations between pollinator abundanceand the indicator value. The level of correlation is satisfying for this type of indicator, which might befurther improved with additional data on plant traits. Coupling this indicator with a model that assessesthe impact of management on plant diversity and abundance will be a further step to help agronomistswho work on the improvement of arable farming management in order to lower its negative impact onpollination.","author":[{"literal":"Charles Ricou"},{"family":"Schneller","given":"Chloé"},{"family":"Amiaud","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Plantureux","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Bockstaller","given":"Christian"}],"container-title":"Ecological Indicators","issue":"45","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,25]]},"page":"320-331","title":"A vegetation-based indicator to assess the pollinationvalue of field margin flora","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X14001241"},

  {"id":"EckertEtAl_2008","abstract":"There is growing interest in quantifying genetic population structure across the geographical ranges of species to understand why species might exhibit stable range limits and to assess the conservation value of peripheral populations. However, many assertions regarding peripheral populations rest on the long-standing but poorly tested supposition that peripheral populations exhibit low genetic diversity and greater genetic differentiation as a consequence of smaller effective population size and greater geographical isolation relative to geographically central populations. We reviewed 134 studies representing 115 species that tested for declines in within-population genetic diversity and/or increases in among-population differentiation towards range margins using nuclear molecular genetic markers. On average, 64.2% of studies detected the expected decline in diversity, 70.2% of those that tested for it showed increased differentiation and there was a positive association between these trends. In most cases, however, the difference in genetic diversity between central and peripheral population was not large. Although these results were consistent across plants and animals, strong taxonomic and biogeographical biases in the available studies call for a cautious generalization of these results. Despite the large number of studies testing these simple predictions, very few attempted to test possible mechanisms causing reduced peripheral diversity or increased differentiation. Almost no study incorporated a phylogeographical framework to evaluate historical influences on contemporary genetic patterns. Finally, there has been little effort to test whether these geographical trends in putatively neutral variation at marker loci are reflected by quantitative genetic trait variation, which is likely to influence the adaptive potential of populations across the geographical range.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Eckert","given":"C.

  {"id":"elith.etal_2010","abstract":"1. Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models’ assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species. 2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an example, predicting potential distributions under both current and climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of extrapolation. 3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment, particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data. Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario. 4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling software, MaxEnt. Our results also show that deliberately controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in non-equilibrium and novel settings. 5. Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate change. Predictions of future species distributions are required for management, but there are acknowledged problems with many current methods, and relatively few advances in techniques for understanding or overcoming these. The methods presented in this manuscript and made accessible in MaxEnt provide a forward step.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Elith","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Kearney","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Steven"}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x","page":"330-342","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The art of modelling range-shifting species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x","volume":"1"},

The species is highly diverse (3.6 alleles/locus) with populations strongly differentiated from each other (FST=0.25). This example is used to illustrate a method for standardizing measures of allelic richness in samples of unequal sample sizes, which was developed for the estimation of the number of species and relies on the technique of rarefaction. In addition, it is shown that the measure of subdivision, θST, obtained when allelic richness is used in place ofh (Nei's index of diversity), is much larger than the FST [e.g. θST(40)=0.52, where (40) indicates the specified sample used to estimate the allelic richness]. This suggests that rare alleles (which strongly influence measures of allelic richness) have a more scattered distribution than more frequent ones, a result which raises special conservation issues for the argan tree.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"El Mousadik","given":"A."},{"family":"Petit","given":"R.

  {"id":"ExcoffierEtAl_1992","abstract":"We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Excoffier","given":"L."},{"family":"Smouse","given":"P.

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Fick","given":"Stephen E."},{"family":"Hijmans","given":"Robert J."}],"container-title":"International Journal of Climatology","DOI":"10.1002/joc.5086","ISSN":"1097-0088","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/joc.5086","page":"4302-4315","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"WorldClim 2: new 1-km spatial resolution climate surfaces for global land areas","title-short":"WorldClim 2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.5086","volume":"37"},

It highlights three conservation strategies: communities conserved in nature reserves; individual species conserved in nature reserves or botanic gardens; and domesticated plants, preserved mainly in germplasm collections. Because conservation biology has such a broad scope and relevance to the community at large, it is faced with several controversial issues such as the dichotomy between the preservation of individual species versus a broader focus on the ecosystem; the relative importance to give to endangered species; the design and management of reserves and the value of corridors; and the drive for increasing agricultural productivity through plant improvement versus the drive to maintain traditional peasant varieties in cultivation. Here, these and other issues are examined, by emphasizing and exploring the underlying scientific principles.

  {"id":"Frankham_2015","abstract":"Many species have fragmented distribution with small isolated populations suffering inbreeding depression and/or reduced ability to evolve. Without gene flow from another population within the species (genetic rescue), these populations are likely to be extirpated. However, there have been only 20 published cases of such outcrossing for conservation purposes, probably a very low proportion of populations that would potentially benefit. As one impediment to genetic rescues is the lack of an overview of the magnitude and consistency of genetic rescue effects in wild species, I carried out a meta-analysis. Outcrossing of inbred populations resulted in beneficial effects in 92.9% of 156 cases screened as having a low risk of outbreeding depression. The median increase in composite fitness (combined fecundity and survival) following outcrossing was 148% in stressful environments and 45% in benign ones. Fitness benefits also increased significantly with maternal ΔF (reduction in inbreeding coefficient due to gene flow) and for naturally outbreeding versus inbreeding species. However, benefits did not differ significantly among invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. Evolutionary potential for fitness characters in inbred populations also benefited from gene flow. There are no scientific impediments to the widespread use of outcrossing to genetically rescue inbred populations of naturally outbreeding species, provided potential crosses have a low risk of outbreeding depression.

  {"id":"FrankhamEtAl_2011","abstract":"Abstract: Fragmentation of animal and plant populations typically leads to genetic erosion and increased probability of extirpation. Although these effects can usually be reversed by re-establishing gene flow between population fragments, managers sometimes fail to do so due to fears of outbreeding depression (OD). Rapid development of OD is due primarily to adaptive differentiation from selection or fixation of chromosomal variants. Fixed chromosomal variants can be detected empirically. We used an extended form of the breeders’ equation to predict the probability of OD due to adaptive differentiation between recently isolated population fragments as a function of intensity of selection, genetic diversity, effective population sizes, and generations of isolation. Empirical data indicated that populations in similar environments had not developed OD even after thousands of generations of isolation. To predict the probability of OD, we developed a decision tree that was based on the four variables from the breeders’ equation, taxonomic status, and gene flow within the last 500 years. The predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations is elevated when the populations have at least one of the following characteristics: are distinct species, have fixed chromosomal differences, exchanged no genes in the last 500 years, or inhabit different environments. Conversely, the predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations of the same species is low for populations with the same karyotype, isolated for <500 years, and that occupy similar environments. In the former case, we recommend crossing be avoided or tried on a limited, experimental basis. In the latter case, crossing can be carried out with low probability of OD. We used crosses with known results to test the decision tree and found that it correctly identified cases where OD occurred. Current concerns about OD in recently fragmented populations are almost certainly excessive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Frankham","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ballou","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Eldridge","given":"Mark D.

Internal feeders and sap suckers were prioritized for biological control from over 30 specialized insects identified from the target plant in its native European range. Five leaf-feeding moths were also considered for further investigations. Field observations and preliminary host range tests with the stem-boring beetle Oberea pedemontana, the root-boring moth Synanthedon stomoxiformis, the shoot-tip-boring moth Sorhagenia janiszewskae and the leaf-feeding moths Ancylis apicella, A. unculana, Triphosa dubitata, Philereme transversata and P. vetulata confirmed that all of these species were lacking host specificity in no-choice conditions. Choice oviposition tests carried out with most of the prioritized species to assess their ecological host range yielded unreliable results. Three psyllids, Trichochermes walkeri, Cacopsylla rhamnicolla and Trioza rhamni are promising in terms of host specificity, but are infected with the plant disease ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma rhamni’. Fruit- or seed-feeding insects may present the best potential for biological control of buckthorn in directly reducing seed set and thus seedling establishment. However, it was not possible to obtain adult fruiting trees of native North American Rhamnus species for testing.

Distinguishing the contribution of ecological, historical, and stochastic processes to the origin and maintenance of biogeographic boundaries, however, is a longstanding challenge. Taking advantage of newly available data and methods—including environmental niche models and associated comparative metrics—we develop a framework to test two possible ecological explanations for biogeographic boundaries: (1) sharp environmental gradients and (2) ribbons of unsuitable habitat dividing two highly suitable regions. We test each of these hypotheses against the null expectation that environmental variation across a given boundary is no greater than expected by chance. We apply this framework to a pair of Hispaniolan Anolis lizards (A. chlorocyanus and A. coelestinus) distributed on the either side of this island's most important biogeographic boundary. Integrating our results with historical biogeographic analysis, we find that a ribbon of particularly unsuitable habitat is acting to maintain a boundary between species that initially diverged on distinct paleo-islands, which merged to form present-day Hispaniola in the Miocene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Glor","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Warren","given":"Dan"}],"container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01177.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01177.x","page":"673-683","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Testing Ecological Explanations for Biogeographic Boundaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01177.x","volume":"65"},

The scenario begins with the potential co-facilitation between the European earthworm Lumbricus terrestris and European buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica. Once introduced, European buckthorn has served as the overwintering host for two important invasive crop pests, oat crown rust, Puccinea coronata and the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines. The spread of R. cathartica itself may have been aided by seed dispersal by the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, and the presence of L. terrestris has likely facilitated the invasion of Bipalium adventitium, an Asian predatory flatworm that specializes on earthworms. Beyond this, the soybean aphid is consumed by a number of introduced species, including the lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, the ground beetle Agonum muelleri and the parasitoid Aphelinus certus. We hypothesize that the presence of soybean aphid increases regional abundances of these species. We discuss both the evidence for this multi-species invasional meltdown scenario and potential implications of meltdown dynamics for invasive species management. The particular management issues that we discuss are: (1) opportunities for managing multiple invasive species simultaneously by targeting facilitator species, and (2) implications of meltdown dynamics for biological control introductions against the soybean aphid.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Heimpel","given":"George E."},{"family":"Frelich","given":"Lee E."},{"family":"Landis","given":"Douglas A."},{"family":"Hopper","given":"Keith R."},{"family":"Hoelmer","given":"Kim A."},{"family":"Sezen","given":"Zeynep"},{"family":"Asplen","given":"Mark K."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Kongming"}],"container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-010-9736-5","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2913-2931","source":"Springer Link","title":"European buckthorn and Asian soybean aphid as components of an extensive invasional meltdown in North America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-010-9736-5","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"hicks.etal._2016","abstract":"Planted meadows are increasingly used to improve the biodiversity and aesthetic amenity value of urban areas. Although many ‘pollinator-friendly’ seed mixes are available, the floral resources these provide to flower-visiting insects, and how these change through time, are largely unknown. Such data are necessary to compare the resources provided by alternative meadow seed mixes to each other and to other flowering habitats. We used quantitative surveys of over 2 million flowers to estimate the nectar and pollen resources offered by two exemplar commercial seed mixes (one annual, one perennial) and associated weeds grown as 300m2 meadows across four UK cities, sampled at six time points between May and September 2013. Nectar sugar and pollen rewards per flower varied widely across 65 species surveyed, with native British weed species (including dandelion, Taraxacum agg.) contributing the top five nectar producers and two of the top ten pollen producers. Seed mix species yielding the highest rewards per flower included Leontodon hispidus, Centaurea cyanus and C. nigra for nectar, and Papaver rhoeas, Eschscholzia californica and Malva moschata for pollen. Perennial meadows produced up to 20x more nectar and up to 6x more pollen than annual meadows, which in turn produced far more than amenity grassland controls. Perennial meadows produced resources earlier in the year than annual meadows, but both seed mixes delivered very low resource levels early in the year and these were provided almost entirely by native weeds. Pollen volume per flower is well predicted statistically by floral morphology, and nectar sugar mass and pollen volume per unit area are correlated with flower counts, raising the possibility that resource levels can be estimated for species or habitats where they cannot be measured directly. Our approach does not incorporate resource quality information (for example, pollen protein or essential amino acid content), but can easily do so when suitable data exist. Our approach should inform the design of new seed mixes to ensure continuity in floral resource availability throughout the year, and to identify suitable species to fill resource gaps in established mixes.","author":[{"family":"Hicks","given":"Damien M."},{"family":"et al.","given":""}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0158117","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,24]]},"title":"Food for Pollinators: Quantifying the Nectar and Pollen Resources of Urban Flower Meadows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158117","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"hirzel.etal_2006","abstract":"Models predicting species spatial distribution are increasingly applied to wildlife management issues, emphasising the need for reliable methods to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions. As many available datasets (e.g. museums, herbariums, atlas) do not provide reliable information about species absences, several presence-only based analyses have been developed. However, methods to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions are few and have never been validated. The aim of this paper is to compare existing and new presence-only evaluators to usual presence/absence measures. We use a reliable, diverse, presence/absence dataset of 114 plant species to test how common presence/absence indices (Kappa, MaxKappa, AUC, adjusted D2) compare to presence-only measures (AVI, CVI, Boyce index) for evaluating generalised linear models (GLM). Moreover we propose a new, threshold-independent evaluator, which we call “continuous Boyce index”. All indices were implemented in the BIOMAPPER software. We show that the presence-only evaluators are fairly correlated (ρ>0.7) to the presence/absence ones. The Boyce indices are closer to AUC than to MaxKappa and are fairly insensitive to species prevalence. In addition, the Boyce indices provide predicted-to-expected ratio curves that offer further insights into the model quality: robustness, habitat suitability resolution and deviation from randomness. This information helps reclassifying predicted maps into meaningful habitat suitability classes. The continuous Boyce index is thus both a complement to usual evaluation of presence/absence models and a reliable measure of presence-only based predictions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirzel","given":"Alexandre H."},{"family":"Le Lay","given":"Gwenaëlle"},{"family":"Helfer","given":"Véronique"},{"family":"Randin","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"}],"collection-title":"Predicting Species Distributions","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.05.017","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,11,16]]},"language":"en","page":"142-152","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Evaluating the ability of habitat suitability models to predict species presences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006002468","volume":"199"},
  {"id":"HoldereggerEtAl_2006","abstract":"Genetic diversity is important for the maintenance of the viability and the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations and species. However, there are two principal types of genetic diversity: adaptive and neutral – a fact widely neglected by non-specialists. We introduce these two types of genetic diversity and critically point to their potential uses and misuses in population or landscape genetic studies. First, most molecular-genetic laboratory techniques analyse neutral genetic variation. This means that the gene variants detected do not have any direct effect on fitness. This type of genetic variation is thus selectively neutral and tells us nothing about the adaptive or evolutionary potential of a population or a species. Nevertheless, neutral genetic markers have great potential for investigating processes such as gene flow, migration or dispersal. Hence, they allow us to empirically test the functional relevance of spatial indices such as connectivity used in landscape ecology. Second, adaptive genetic variation, i.e. genetic variation under natural selection, is analysed in quantitative genetic experiments under controlled and uniform environmental conditions. Unfortunately, the genetic variation (i.e. heritability) and population differentiation at quantitative, adaptive traits is not directly linked with neutral genetic diversity or differentiation. Thus, neutral genetic data cannot serve as a surrogate of adaptive genetic data. In summary, neutral genetic diversity is well suited for the study of processes within landscapes such as gene flow, while the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations or species has to be assessed in quantitative genetic experiments. Landscape ecologists have to mind these differences between neutral and adaptive genetic variation when interpreting the results of landscape genetic studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Holderegger","given":"Rolf"},{"family":"Kamm","given":"Urs"},{"family":"Gugerli","given":"Felix"}],"container-title":"Landscape Ecology","container-title-short":"Landscape Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/s10980-005-5245-9","ISSN":"1572-9761","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"797-807","source":"Springer Link","title":"Adaptive vs. neutral genetic diversity: implications for landscape genetics","title-short":"Adaptive vs. neutral genetic diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-005-5245-9","volume":"21"},

In this study, we aimed to determine whether admixture among multiple lineages, dispersal mechanisms, and high genetic diversity have contributed to the invasion of P. a. australis in the northeastern part of its range. Understanding mechanisms of the P. a. australis invasion will 1) contribute to a broader understanding of the factors that facilitate plant invasion, and 2) help us to develop effective management strategies for wetlands threatened by P. a. australis invasion. • Methods: We used a population genetics approach incorporating nine microsatellite loci to study genetic diversity and population structure in relation to biogeography of introduced North American Phragmites a. australis stands in the northeastern continental region. • Key Results: Phragmites a. australis is genetically diverse in the region studied here. Significant population structure exists, and population structure is likely influenced by both long-distance dispersal via major waterways, and short-distance dispersal overland. Different lineages sometimes colonize geographically proximate locations leading to opportunities for admixture. Clonal reproduction likely exaggerates geographical structure among some stands, although high genetic and clonal diversity within some stands implies that sexual reproduction occurs frequently in P. a. australis. • Conclusions: A variety of factors, including admixture among multiple lineages, multiple modes of dispersal, and plasticity in reproductive strategy promote the invasion success of Phragmites a. australis. Wetland managers in the St. Lawrence River/Great Lakes region should focus monitoring efforts on the shores of conservation lands to prevent the establishment of propagules from novel lineages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirk","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Straka","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Freeland","given":"Joanna R."}],"container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.3732/ajb.1000278","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.1000278","page":"1180-1190","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Long-distance dispersal and high genetic diversity are implicated in the invasive spread of the common reed, Phragmites australis (Poaceae), in northeastern North America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.1000278","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"LawsonEtAl_2012","abstract":"1. There is a pressing need to understand how to facilitate species’ range shifts under climate change. However, few empirical studies are available to inform decision-making, particularly at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. 2. We present a case study of a thermally constrained habitat specialist, the silver-spotted skipper butterfly Hesperia comma, at its expanding range margin in south-eastern Britain. Using data from 724 habitat patches over a 9-year interval (2000–2009), we examined local and landscape determinants of colonization, survival and population density. We then predicted probabilities of colonization and survival for habitat patches under the observed 1982 and 2009 distributions to investigate how the factors limiting range expansions change through space and time. 3. Between 2000 and 2009, Hesperia comma continued to expand its range in Britain, but the 67 recorded colonization events were offset by 48 local extinctions. Extinctions were strongly linked to climate, occurring predominantly in cooler regions and on shaded north-facing slopes. 4. Population density and probability of survival were closely related to conditions within a site, whereas probability of colonization was largely determined by functional connectivity. Survival probability was also influenced by connectivity, suggesting that immigration helped to support extinction-prone populations (a ‘rescue effect’). 5. Patch occupancy beyond the range margin was primarily constrained by colonization, but close to the expanding front, population survival became the key limiting factor. This pattern was conserved during range expansion, altering management priorities at individual sites. 6. Synthesis and applications. Previous studies on facilitating range shifts have stressed the need to increase landscape-scale connectivity to remove constraints on colonization, and our data substantiate this advice. However, we show that enhancing population survival can also help to facilitate range expansions, because populations at leading range edges face high extinction risk. Population survival can be improved directly through local management actions, such as enlarging patch size and increasing habitat quality, or indirectly by improving connectivity. Thus, local management can secure vulnerable populations at the range edge and provide larger and more stable migrant sources for future expansion and deserves consideration when facilitating range shifts under climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lawson","given":"Callum R."},{"family":"Bennie","given":"Jonathan J."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Chris D."},{"family":"Hodgson","given":"Jenny A."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Robert J."}],"container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02098.x","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02098.x","page":"552-561","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Local and landscape management of an expanding range margin under climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02098.x","volume":"49"},

Despite a spatial imbalance towards the most developed regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a taxonomic bias towards the most charismatic animals and plants of the planet, data show that marine species are better at tracking isotherm shifts, and move towards the pole six times faster than terrestrial species. More specifically, we find that marine species closely track shifting isotherms in warm and relatively undisturbed waters (for example, the Central Pacific Basin) or in cold waters subject to high human pressures (for example, the North Sea). On land, human activities impede the capacity of terrestrial species to track isotherm shifts in latitude, with some species shifting in the opposite direction to isotherms. Along elevational gradients, species follow the direction of isotherm shifts but at a pace that is much slower than expected, especially in areas with warm climates. Our results suggest that terrestrial species are lagging behind shifting isotherms more than marine species, which is probably related to the interplay between the wider thermal safety margin of terrestrial versus marine species and the more constrained physical environment for dispersal in terrestrial versus marine habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lenoir","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Bertrand","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Comte","given":"Lise"},{"family":"Bourgeaud","given":"Luana"},{"family":"Hattab","given":"Tarek"},{"family":"Murienne","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Grenouillet","given":"Gaël"}],"container-title":"Nature Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1038/s41559-020-1198-2","ISSN":"2397-334X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,25]]},"language":"en","page":"1-16","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Species better track climate warming in the oceans than on land","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1198-2"},

Public policy supports the conservation of peripheral populations, despite the commonness of the species elsewhere. However, the conservation of significant peripheral populations of nonlisted plants has been arbitrary and ineffective. The absence of explicit criteria to determine the conservation value of peripheral plant populations, the lack of finer-scale data on plant distributions, and a general unawareness of their value have hindered efforts to conserve them.

However, restoration efforts can result in the introduction of novel genes and genotypes into populations when plant materials used are not of local origin. This movement is potentially important because many plant species are subdivided into populations that are adapted to local environmental conditions. Here we focus on genetic concerns arising from ongoing restoration efforts, where often little is known about ?How local is local?? (i.e., the geographic or environmental scale over which plant species are adapted). We review the major issues regarding gene flow and local adaptation in the restoration of natural plant populations. Finally, we offer some practical, commonsense guidelines for the consideration of genetic structure when restoring natural plant populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"McKay","given":"John K."},{"family":"Christian","given":"Caroline E."},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Rice","given":"Kevin J."}],"container-title":"Restoration Ecology","container-title-short":"Restoration Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00058.x@10.1111/(ISSN)1526-100X.2525thAnniversaryVI","ISSN":"1061-2971","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"page":"432-440","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","title":"“How Local Is Local?”—A Review of Practical and Conceptual Issues in the Genetics of Restoration","title-short":"“How Local Is Local?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00058.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291526-100X.2525thAnniversaryVI"},
  {"id":"merow.etal_2013","abstract":"The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt’s calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt’s outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Merow","given":"Cory"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Silander","given":"John A."}],"container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x","page":"1058-1069","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A practical guide to MaxEnt for modeling species’ distributions: what it does, and why inputs and settings matter","title-short":"A practical guide to MaxEnt for modeling species’ distributions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"muscarella.etal_2014","abstract":"Recent studies have demonstrated a need for increased rigour in building and evaluating ecological niche models (ENMs) based on presence-only occurrence data. Two major goals are to balance goodness-of-fit with model complexity (e.g. by ‘tuning’ model settings) and to evaluate models with spatially independent data. These issues are especially critical for data sets suffering from sampling bias, and for studies that require transferring models across space or time (e.g. responses to climate change or spread of invasive species). Efficient implementation of procedures to accomplish these goals, however, requires automation. We developed ENMeval, an R package that: (i) creates data sets for k-fold cross-validation using one of several methods for partitioning occurrence data (including options for spatially independent partitions), (ii) builds a series of candidate models using Maxent with a variety of user-defined settings and (iii) provides multiple evaluation metrics to aid in selecting optimal model settings. The six methods for partitioning data are n−1 jackknife, random k-folds ( = bins), user-specified folds and three methods of masked geographically structured folds. ENMeval quantifies six evaluation metrics: the area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic plot for test localities (AUCTEST), the difference between training and testing AUC (AUCDIFF), two different threshold-based omission rates for test localities and the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc). We demonstrate ENMeval by tuning model settings for eight tree species of the genus Coccoloba in Puerto Rico based on AICc. Evaluation metrics varied substantially across model settings, and models selected with AICc differed from default ones. In summary, ENMeval facilitates the production of better ENMs and should promote future methodological research on many outstanding issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Muscarella","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Galante","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Soley‐Guardia","given":"Mariano"},{"family":"Boria","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Kass","given":"Jamie M."},{"family":"Uriarte","given":"María"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Robert P."}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12261","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12261","page":"1198-1205","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"ENMeval: An R package for conducting spatially independent evaluations and estimating optimal model complexity for Maxent ecological niche models","title-short":"ENMeval","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12261","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"norton.etal_2019","abstract":"There are increasing calls to provide greenspace in urban areas, yet the ecological quality, as well as quantity, of greenspace is important. Short mown grassland designed for recreational use is the dominant form of urban greenspace in temperate regions but requires considerable maintenance and typically provides limited habitat value for most taxa. Alternatives are increasingly proposed, but the biodiversity potential of these is not well understood. In a replicated experiment across six public urban greenspaces, we used nine different perennial meadow plantings to quantify the relative roles of floristic diversity and height of sown meadows on the richness and composition of three taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, and soil microbes. We found that all meadow treatments were colonized by plant species not sown in the plots, suggesting that establishing sown meadows does not preclude further locally determined grassland development if management is appropriate. Colonizing species were rarer in taller and more diverse plots, indicating competition may limit invasion rates. Urban meadow treatments contained invertebrate and microbial communities that differed from mown grassland. Invertebrate taxa responded to changes in both height and richness of meadow vegetation, but most orders were more abundant where vegetation height was longer than mown grassland. Order richness also increased in longer vegetation and Coleoptera family richness increased with plant diversity in summer. Microbial community composition seems sensitive to plant species composition at the soil surface (0–10 cm), but in deeper soils (11–20 cm) community variation was most responsive to plant height, with bacteria and fungi responding differently. In addition to improving local residents’ site satisfaction, native perennial meadow plantings can produce biologically diverse grasslands that support richer and more abundant invertebrate communities, and restructured plant, invertebrate, and soil microbial communities compared with short mown grassland. Our results suggest that diversification of urban greenspace by planting urban meadows in place of some mown amenity grassland is likely to generate substantial biodiversity benefits, with a mosaic of meadow types likely to maximize such benefits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Norton","given":"Briony A."},{"family":"Bending","given":"Gary D."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Corstanje","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Dunnett","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Karl L."},{"family":"Grafius","given":"Darren R."},{"family":"Gravestock","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Grice","given":"Samuel M."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Jim A."},{"family":"Hilton","given":"Sally"},{"family":"Hoyle","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Mercer","given":"Theresa G."},{"family":"Pawlett","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Pescott","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Richards","given":"J.

  {"id":"petitpierre.etal_2016","abstract":"Mountain ecosystems have been less adversely affected by invasions of nonnative plants than most other ecosystems, partially because most invasive plants in the lowlands are limited by climate and cannot grow under harsher high-elevation conditions. However, with ongoing climate change, invasive species may rapidly move upwards and threaten mid-, and then high-elevation mountain ecosystems. We evaluated this threat by modeling the current and future habitat suitability for 48 invasive plant species in Switzerland and New South Wales, Australia. Both regions had contrasting climate interactions with elevation, resulting in possible different responses of species distributions to climate change. Using a species distribution modeling approach that combines data from two spatial scales, we built high-resolution species distribution models (≤250 m) that account for the global climatic niche of species and also finer variables depicting local climate and disturbances. We found that different environmental drivers limit the elevation range of invasive species in each of the two regions, leading to region-specific species responses to climate change. The optimal suitability for plant invaders is predicted to markedly shift from the lowland to the montane or subalpine zone in Switzerland, whereas the upward shift is far less pronounced in New South Wales where montane and subalpine elevations are already suitable. The results suggest that species most likely to invade high elevations in Switzerland will be cold-tolerant, whereas species with an affinity to moist soils are most likely to invade higher elevations in Australia. Other plant traits were only marginally associated with elevation limits. These results demonstrate that a more systematic consideration of future distributions of invasive species is required in conservation plans of not yet invaded mountainous ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Petitpierre","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"McDougall","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Seipel","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Broennimann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Kueffer","given":"Christoph"}],"container-title":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1890/14-1871","ISSN":"1939-5582","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/14-1871","page":"530-544","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Will climate change increase the risk of plant invasions into mountains?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/14-1871","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"petitpierre.etal_2017","abstract":"Aim Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to predict impacts of global change on biodiversity, but the reliability of these predictions in space and time depends on their transferability. We tested how the strategy used to choose predictors impacts the transferability of SDMs at a cross-continental scale. Location North America, Eurasia and Australia. Method We used a systematic approach including 50 Holarctic plant invaders and 27 initial predictor variables, considering 10 different strategies for variable selection, accounting for the proximality, multicollinearity and climate analogy of predictors. We compared the average performance of each strategy, some of which used a large number of predictor combinations. Next, we looked for the single best model for each species across all the predictor combinations retained in the analysis. Transferability was considered as the predictive success of SDMs calibrated in the native range and projected onto the invaded range. Results Two strategies showed better SDM transferability on average: a set of predictors known for their ecologically meaningful effects on plant distribution, and the two first axes of a principal component analysis calibrated on all predictor variables (Spc2). From the more than 2000 combinations of predictors per species across strategies, the best set of predictors yielded SDMs with good transferability for 45 species (90%). These best combinations consisted of eight randomly assembled (39 species) or uncorrelated predictors (6 species) and Spc2 (5 species). We also found that internal cross-validation was not sufficient to give full information about the transferability of a SDM to a distinct range. Main conclusion Transferring SDMs at the macroclimatic scale, and thus anticipating invasions, is possible for the large majority of invasive plants considered in this study, but the accuracy of the predictions relies strongly on the choice of predictors. From our results, we recommend including either proximal and state-of-the-art variables or a reduced and orthogonalized set to obtain robust SDM projections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Petitpierre","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"Broennimann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Kueffer","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Daehler","given":"Curtis"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"}],"container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/geb.12530","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.12530","page":"275-287","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Selecting predictors to maximize the transferability of species distribution models: lessons from cross-continental plant invasions","title-short":"Selecting predictors to maximize the transferability of species distribution models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12530","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"pironon.etal_2017","abstract":"The ‘centre–periphery hypothesis’ (CPH) is a long-standing postulate in ecology that states that genetic variation and demographic performance of a species decrease from the centre to the edge of its geographic range. This hypothesis is based on an assumed concordance between geographical peripherality and ecological marginality such that environmental conditions become harsher towards the limits of a species range. In this way, the CPH sets the stage for understanding the causes of distribution limits. To date, no study has examined conjointly the consistency of these postulates. In an extensive literature review we discuss the birth and development of the CPH and provide an assessment of the CPH by reviewing 248 empirical studies in the context of three main themes. First, a decrease in species occurrence towards their range limits was observed in 81% of studies, while only 51% demonstrated reduced abundance of individuals. A decline in genetic variation, increased differentiation among populations and higher rates of inbreeding were demonstrated by roughly one in two studies (47, 45 and 48%, respectively). However, demographic rates, size and population performance less often followed CPH expectations (20–30% of studies). We highlight the impact of important methodological, taxonomic, and biogeographical biases on such validation rates. Second, we found that geographic and ecological marginality gradients are not systematically concordant, which casts doubt on the reliability of a main assumption of the CPH. Finally, we attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of geographical, ecological and historical processes on the spatial distribution of genetic and demographic parameters. While ecological marginality gradients explain variation in species' demographic performance better than geographic gradients, contemporary and historical factors may contribute interactively to spatial patterns of genetic variation. We thereby propose a framework that integrates species' ecological niche characteristics together with current and past range structure to investigate spatial patterns of genetic and demographic variation across species ranges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Pironon","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Papuga","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Villellas","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"Angert","given":"Amy L."},{"family":"García","given":"María B."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"John D."}],"container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12313","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12313","page":"1877-1909","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Geographic variation in genetic and demographic performance: new insights from an old biogeographical paradigm","title-short":"Geographic variation in genetic and demographic performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12313","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"PritchardEtAl_2000","abstract":"We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci—e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

  {"id":"radosavljevic.anderson_2014","abstract":"Aim Models of species niches and distributions have become invaluable to biogeographers over the past decade, yet several outstanding methodological issues remain. Here we address three critical ones: selecting appropriate evaluation data, detecting overfitting, and tuning program settings to approximate optimal model complexity. We integrate solutions to these issues for Maxent models, using the Caribbean spiny pocket mouse, Heteromys anomalus, as an example. Location North-western South America. Methods We partitioned data into calibration and evaluation datasets via three variations of k-fold cross-validation: randomly partitioned, geographically structured and masked geographically structured (which restricts background data to regions corresponding to calibration localities). Then, we carried out tuning experiments by varying the level of regularization, which controls model complexity. Finally, we gauged performance by quantifying discriminatory ability and overfitting, as well as via visual inspections of maps of the predictions in geography. Results Performance varied among data-partitioning approaches and among regularization multipliers. The randomly partitioned approach inflated estimates of model performance and the geographically structured approach showed high overfitting. In contrast, the masked geographically structured approach allowed selection of high-performing models based on all criteria. Discriminatory ability showed a slight peak in performance around the default regularization multiplier. However, regularization levels two to four times higher than the default yielded substantially lower overfitting. Visual inspection of maps of model predictions coincided with the quantitative evaluations. Main conclusions Species-specific tuning of model parameters can improve the performance of Maxent models. Further, accurate estimates of model performance and overfitting depend on using independent evaluation data. These strategies for model evaluation may be useful for other modelling methods as well.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Radosavljevic","given":"Aleksandar"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Robert P."}],"container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/jbi.12227","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jbi.12227","page":"629-643","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Making better Maxent models of species distributions: complexity, overfitting and evaluation","title-short":"Making better Maxent models of species distributions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12227","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"roubicek.etal_2010","abstract":"Ecological niche models (ENMs) have multiple applications in ecology, evolution and conservation planning. They relate the known locations of a species to characteristics of its environment (usually climate) over its geographical range. Most ENMs are trained using standard 30-year (1961–1990) or 50-year (1951–2000) baselines to represent current climate conditions. Species occurrence records used as input to the models, however, are frequently collected from time periods that differ from those from which the climate is derived. Since climate variability can be significant within and outside baselines, and the distributions of some plants and animals (e.g., annual plants, insects) can adjust to environmental conditions on much shorter time scales, this mismatch between collection records and climatic baselines may affect the utility and accuracy of model outputs. We investigated how the choice of baseline periods influenced modelling efforts, anticipating that climate baselines derived from the same temporal period as the species records would yield improved ENMs. Ten simulated species’ distributions were modelled using an ENM (Maxent) for (a) occurrences and climates within the same temporal period, based on eighteen 10-year baselines within the 20th century and (b) all available samples and climate baselines from 1951–2000 and 1961–1990. Each model was projected onto all the available 10-year climate scenarios and compared to the models trained on the corresponding scenario. We show that temporal mismatches of species occurrences and climate baselines can result in significantly poorer distribution models. Such temporal mismatch may be unavoidable for many studies, but we emphasize here the need to match the time range of samples and climate data whenever possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Roubicek","given":"A.

  {"id":"SafrielEtAl_1994","abstract":"<section class=\"abstract\"><p>Environmental conditions outside the periphery of a species' distribution prevent population persistence, hence peripheral populations live under conditions different from those of core populations. Peripheral areas are characterized by variable and unstable conditions, relative to core areas. Peripheral populations are expected to be genetically more variable, since the variable conditions induce fluctuating selection, which maintains high genetic diversity. Alternatively, due to marginal ecological conditions at the periphery, populations there are small and isolated; the within-population diversity is low, but the between-population genetic diversity is high due to genetic drift. It is also likely that peripheral populations evolve resistance to extreme conditions. Thus, peripheral populations rather than core ones may be resistant to environmental extremes and changes, such as global climate change induced by the anthropogenically emitted “greenhouse gases”. They should be treated as a biogenetic resource used for rehabilitation and restoration of damaged ecosystems. Climatic transition zones are characterized by a high incidence of species represented by peripheral populations, and therefore should be conserved now as repositories of these resources, to be used in the future for mitigating undesirable effects of global climate change.

However, to a large degree, the logic and the functioning of many of these applications remain obscure, not only due to the fact that some of the modeling methods are intrinsically complex (neural networks, genetic algorithms, generalized additive models, for example), but mainly because the role of other ecological processes affecting the species distributions sometimes is not explicitly stated. Resorting to fundamental principles of population ecology, a scheme of analysis based on separation of three factors affecting species distributions (environment, biotic interactions and movements) is used to clarify some results of niche modeling exercises. The area of distribution of a virtual species which was generated by both environmental and biotic factors serves to illustrate the possibility that, at coarse resolutions, the distribution can be approximately recovered using only information about the environmental factors and ignoring the biotic interactions. Finally, information on the distribution of a butterfly species, Baronia brevicornis, is used to illustrate the importance of interpreting the results of niche models by including hypothesis about one class of movements. The results clarify the roles of the three factors in interpreting the results of using correlative approaches to modeling species distributions or their niches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Soberón","given":"Jorge M."}],"container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06074.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06074.x","page":"159-167","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Niche and area of distribution modeling: a population ecology perspective","title-short":"Niche and area of distribution modeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06074.x","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"VincetiEtAl_2013","abstract":"Conservation priorities for Prunus africana, a tree species found across Afromontane regions, which is of great commercial interest internationally and of local value for rural communities, were defined with the aid of spatial analyses applied to a set of georeferenced molecular marker data (chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites) from 32 populations in 9 African countries. Two approaches for the selection of priority populations for conservation were used, differing in the way they optimize representation of intra-specific diversity of P. africana across a minimum number of populations. The first method (S1) was aimed at maximizing genetic diversity of the conservation units and their distinctiveness with regard to climatic conditions, the second method (S2) at optimizing representativeness of the genetic diversity found throughout the species’ range. Populations in East African countries (especially Kenya and Tanzania) were found to be of great conservation value, as suggested by previous findings. These populations are complemented by those in Madagascar and Cameroon. The combination of the two methods for prioritization led to the identification of a set of 6 priority populations. The potential distribution of P. africana was then modeled based on a dataset of 1,500 georeferenced observations. This enabled an assessment of whether the priority populations identified are exposed to threats from agricultural expansion and climate change, and whether they are located within the boundaries of protected areas. The range of the species has been affected by past climate change and the modeled distribution of P. africana indicates that the species is likely to be negatively affected in future, with an expected decrease in distribution by 2050. Based on these insights, further research at the regional and national scale is recommended, in order to strengthen P. africana conservation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Vinceti","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Loo","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Gaisberger","given":"Hannes"},{"family":"Zonneveld","given":"Maarten J.","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Schueler","given":"Silvio"},{"family":"Konrad","given":"Heino"},{"family":"Kadu","given":"Caroline A.

  {"id":"walden.etal_","abstract":"Adaptation to local climatic conditions is commonly found within species, but whether it involves the same intraspecific genomic variants is unknown. We studied this question in North American Arabidopsis lyrata, whose current distribution is shaped by post-glacial range expansion from two refugia, resulting in two distinct genetic clusters covering comparable climatic gradients. Using pooled whole-genome sequence data of 41 outcrossing populations, we identified loci associated with three niche-determining climatic variables in the two clusters and compared these outliers. Little evidence was found for parallelism in climate adaptation for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and for genes with an accumulation of outlier SNPs. Significantly increased selection coefficients supported them as candidates of climate adaptation. However, the fraction of gene ontology (GO) terms shared between clusters was higher compared to outlier SNPs and outlier genes, suggesting that selection acts on similar pathways but not necessarily the same genes. Enriched GO terms involved responses to abiotic and biotic stress, circadian rhythm and development, with flower development and reproduction being among the most frequently detected. In line with GO enrichment, regulators of flowering time were detected as outlier genes. Our results suggest that while adaptation to environmental gradients on the genomic level are lineage-specific in A. lyrata, similar biological processes seem to be involved. Differential loss of standing genetic variation, probably driven by genetic drift, can in part account for the lack of parallel evolution on the genomic level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Walden","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Lucek","given":"Kay"},{"family":"Willi","given":"Yvonne"}],"container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.15338","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"n/a","language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.15338","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Lineage-specific adaptation to climate involves flowering time in North American Arabidopsis lyrata","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.15338","volume":"n/a"},

The question of whether environmental niches are conserved over evolutionary time scales has attracted considerable attention, but often produced conflicting conclusions. This conflict, however, may result from differences in how niche similarity is measured and the specific null hypothesis being tested. We develop new methods for quantifying niche overlap that rely on a traditional ecological measure and a metric from mathematical statistics. We reexamine a classic study of niche conservatism between sister species in several groups of Mexican animals, and, for the first time, address alternative definitions of “niche conservatism” within a single framework using consistent methods. As expected, we find that environmental niches of sister species are more similar than expected under three distinct null hypotheses, but that they are rarely identical. We demonstrate how our measures can be used in phylogenetic comparative analyses by reexamining niche divergence in an adaptive radiation of Cuban anoles. Our results show that environmental niche overlap is closely tied to geographic overlap, but not to phylogenetic distances, suggesting that niche conservatism has not constrained local communities in this group to consist of closely related species. We suggest various randomization tests that may prove useful in other areas of ecology and evolutionary biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Warren","given":"Dan L."},{"family":"Glor","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Turelli","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x","page":"2868-2883","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Environmental Niche Equivalency Versus Conservatism: Quantitative Approaches to Niche Evolution","title-short":"Environmental Niche Equivalency Versus Conservatism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x","volume":"62"},

We demonstrate that models that are inappropriately complex or inappropriately simple show reduced ability to infer habitat quality, reduced ability to infer the relative importance of variables in constraining species' distributions, and reduced transferability to other time periods.

  {"id":"watson.etal_2020","abstract":"Intensive management of urban lawns is globally widespread, predominantly for aesthetic reasons. However, a growing body of knowledge demonstrates negative ecological and environmental effects of this practice. We present a meta-analysis of North American and European studies from 2004 to 2019, which incorporates three previously unpublished datasets from eastern Canada, to investigate how mowing intensity impacts the ecology of urban lawns. The meta-analysis provides aggregated evidence that invertebrate and plant diversity is lower in urban lawns under increased mowing intensity. This decline is independent of the level of contrast between mowing ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ (e.g. height or frequency of mowing), which differed considerably between studies. Intensive mowing also increases the occurrence of pest species (e.g. herbivorous beetle larvae and allergenic plants), though studies in this group were limited to northern environments. Changes in ecosystem-level variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit and carbon deficit) were less evident and suggest changes in abiotic processes may take longer to become apparent. An economic case study of the mowing costs in Trois-Rivières, Canada, suggests that cost savings of 36% may be possible with a modest reduction of mowing frequency. Synthesis and Applications. Increasing urban biodiversity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strong motivators for reducing lawn management intensity. We also suggest that the benefits of reducing pest species while saving lawn management costs may provide additional social and economic incentives for decision makers to review urban greenspace management practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Watson","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Carignan‐Guillemette","given":"Léonie"},{"family":"Turcotte","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Maire","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Proulx","given":"Raphaël"}],"container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.13542","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.13542","page":"436-446","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ecological and economic benefits of low-intensity urban lawn management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.13542","volume":"57"},
  {"id":"WeeksEtAl_2011","abstract":"Translocations are being increasingly proposed as a way of conserving biodiversity, particularly in the management of threatened and keystone species, with the aims of maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function under the combined pressures of habitat fragmentation and climate change. Evolutionary genetic considerations should be an important part of translocation strategies, but there is often confusion about concepts and goals. Here, we provide a classification of translocations based on specific genetic goals for both threatened species and ecological restoration, separating targets based on ‘genetic rescue’ of current population fitness from those focused on maintaining adaptive potential. We then provide a framework for assessing the genetic benefits and risks associated with translocations and provide guidelines for managers focused on conserving biodiversity and evolutionary processes. Case studies are developed to illustrate the framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Weeks","given":"Andrew R."},{"family":"Sgro","given":"Carla M."},{"family":"Young","given":"Andrew G."},{"family":"Frankham","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Nicki J."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Kim A."},{"family":"Byrne","given":"Margaret"},{"family":"Coates","given":"David J."},{"family":"Eldridge","given":"Mark D.

  {"id":"willi.vanbuskirk_2019","abstract":"Factors that limit the geographic distribution of species are broadly important in ecology and evolutionary biology, and understanding distribution limits is imperative for predicting how species will respond to environmental change. Good data indicate that factors such as dispersal limitation, small effective population size, and isolation are sometimes important. But empirical research highlights no single factor that explains the ubiquity of distribution limits. In this article, we outline a guide to tackling distribution limits that integrates established causes, such as dispersal limitation and spatial environmental heterogeneity, with understudied causes, such as mutational load and genetic or developmental integration of traits limiting niche expansion. We highlight how modeling and quantitative genetic and genomic analyses can provide insight into sources of distribution limits. Our practical guide provides a framework for considering the many factors likely to determine species distributions and how the different approaches can be integrated to predict distribution limits using eco-evolutionary modeling. The framework should also help predict distribution limits of invasive species and of species under climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Willi","given":"Yvonne"},{"family":"Van Buskirk","given":"Josh"}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/703172","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"page":"773-785","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"A Practical Guide to the Study of Distribution Limits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/703172","volume":"193"},
  {"id":"YakimowskiEckert_2007","abstract":"Abstract: Geographically peripheral populations of widespread species are often the focus of conservation because they are locally rare within political jurisdictions. Yet the ecology and genetics of these populations are rarely evaluated in a broader geographic context. Most expectations concerning the ecology and evolution of peripheral populations derive from the abundant-center model, which predicts that peripheral populations should be less frequent, smaller, less dense, and have a lower reproductive rate than central populations. We tested these predictions and in doing so evaluated the conservation value of peripheral populations for the clonal shrub Vaccinium stamineum L. (Ericaceae, deerberry), which is listed as threatened in Canada. Based on 51 populations sampled from the center to the northern range limits over 2 years, population frequency and size declined toward the range limit, but ramet density increased. Sexual reproductive output varied widely among populations and between years, with many populations producing very few seeds, but did not decline toward range margins. In fact seed mass increased steadily toward range limit, and this was associated with faster germination and seedling growth, which may be adaptive in seasonal northern environments. Our results did not support the prediction that clonal reproduction is more prevalent in peripheral populations or that it contributed antagonistically to the wide variation in seed production. Peripheral populations of V. stamineum are as productive as central populations and may be locally adapted to northern environments. This emphasizes the importance of a broad geographical perspective for evaluating the ecology, evolution, and conservation of peripheral populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Yakimowski","given":"Sarah B."},{"family":"Eckert","given":"Christopher G."}],"container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00684.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00684.x","page":"811-822","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Threatened Peripheral Populations in Context: Geographical Variation in Population Frequency and Size and Sexual Reproduction in a Clonal Woody Shrub","title-short":"Threatened Peripheral Populations in Context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00684.x","volume":"21"},
