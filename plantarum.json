  {"id":"AdamackGruber_2014","abstract":"Using scripting languages such as R to perform population genetic analyses can improve the reproducibility of research, but using R can be challenging for many researchers due to its steep learning curve. PopGenReport is a new R package that simplifies performing population genetics analyses in R, through the use of a new report-generating function. The function popgenreport allows users to perform up to 13 pre-defined and 1 user-defined analyses through the use of a single command line. Each analysis generates figures and tables that are incorporated into a pdf report and are also made available as individual files (figures are provided in multiple formats, table contents are provided as csv files). The package includes new R functions that simplify the importation of data from a spreadsheet file, examine allele distributions across populations and loci and identify private alleles, determine pairwise individual genetic distances using the methods of Smouse and Peakall () and Kosman and Leonard (), respectively, detect the presence of null alleles, calculate allelic richness, and test for spatial autocorrelation in genotypes using the methods of Smouse and Peakall (). The package has a modular structure that makes the process of adding new functionality straightforward. To facilitate the addition of user-designed functions, the package includes a fully customizable module that can be automatically included in the pdf report. To support users not experienced in R, the website (www.popgenreport.org) has a tutorial for the package and a downloadable, portable version of the package with LaTeX pre-configured for the Windows operating system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Adamack","given":"Aaron T."},{"family":"Gruber","given":"Bernd"}],"citation-key":"AdamackGruber_2014","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12158","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12158","page":"384-387","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"PopGenReport: simplifying basic population genetic analyses in R","title-short":"PopGenReport","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12158","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"Agren_1988","abstract":"The flowering and fruiting patterns of the dioecious perennial herb Rubus chamaemorus L. were studied in frost-prone (open) and frost-sheltered (shaded) habitats in northern Sweden over 6 years. The number of ramets with flower buds, the proportion of flower buds that opened, and fruit set varied markedly between years. In the frost-prone populations, the occurrence or absence of detrimental frosts during the development of flowers and fruit could explain much of the variation, both in the proportion of flower buds that developed into flowers, and in fruit set. In the frost-sheltered populations, most female flowers that did not develop into fruit aborted without any signs of physical damage and before any ovules had begun to enlarge. Flower mortality caused by herbivores feeding on reproductive parts was commonly low, but reached values higher than 10% in one of the shaded populations. Hand-pollination increased the proportion of ovules producing seeds in the mature fruits by about 20%, and in one year also increased fruit set significantly in one population. Fruit-producing female ramets had a higher mortality and a lower probability of flowering in the subsequent year than male ramets and non-fruiting female ramets. In R. chamaemorus, the conditions for fruit maturation are highly unpredictable at the time of flower initiation. It is suggested that the apparent \"over-initiation\" of flower buds is advantageous, as it allows the plant to attain a high reproductive success in years favourable for flowering and fruit development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,20]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Ågren","given":"Jon"}],"citation-key":"Agren_1988","container-title":"Oecologia","ISSN":"0029-8549","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1988]]},"page":"175-183","publisher":"Springer","source":"JSTOR","title":"Between-Year Variation in Flowering and Fruit Set in Frost-Prone and Frost-Sheltered Populations of Dioecious Rubus chamaemorus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4218655","volume":"76"},

  {"id":"Aguirre-GutierrezEtAl_2017","abstract":"Aim Climate change is expected to have a great impact on the distribution of wild flora around the world. Wild plant species are an important component of the genetic resources for crop improvement, which is especially important in face of climate change impacts. Still, many crop wild relatives (CWRs) are currently threatened in their natural habitat and are poorly represented in gene bank collections. To guide in situ conservation measures and to prioritize species for ex situ conservation, predictions are needed about future species distributions as a result of climate change. Location Europe. Methods Using species occurrence data and present and future climatic information, we investigated the possible impacts of future climate change on the European distribution of a selection of CWRs red-listed in the Netherlands using a species distribution modelling framework. The representation of the CWRs in European protected areas was investigated for the current and future climatic conditions. The models were created based on an optimistic (RCP 2.6) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) climate change scenario. Results A shift in distribution range, mostly towards northern locations, was observed for all investigated species. A loss of distribution area of up to 61.10% (full dispersal assumption) and 68.91% (no dispersal) according to RCP 2.6 was observed for some species. A distribution area loss of up to 90.92% (full dispersal) and 98.36% (no dispersal) was predicted for the most affected species under the RCP 8.5. Based on the predicted distribution in protected areas, present occupation in nature reserves appeared to be no guarantee for the species’ future protection and persistence. Main conclusions We conclude that in situ conservation measures, ignoring the effects of climate change, will not be effective for many CWRs and that large-scale ex situ conservation actions are needed to safeguard CWRs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Aguirre-Gutiérrez","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"Treuren","given":"Rob","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Hoekstra","given":"Roel"},{"family":"Hintum","given":"Theo J.

  {"id":"Al-RababahWilliams_2002","abstract":"Pinus taeda has historically large, interconnecting populations which extend along the US Atlantic seaboard from Maryland to Florida and westward to central Texas. Genetic divergence is greatest east and west of the Mississippi River Valley but there are no estimates of allelic diversity or diagnostic alleles. To test allelic diversity and detect diagnostic alleles, samples were drawn from grafted archives of natural stand selections from 1950 to 1970. The samples represented P. taeda prior to intensive plantation establishment and domestication. The eastern range had higher mean allelic diversity than western populations (10 versus 8.5 alleles per locus) even after adjustment for sample size and geographic area. A total of 46 unique alleles were detected; nine were considered diagnostic. There were more diagnostic alleles east of the Mississippi River Valley compared to the western part of the species’ range. Gene flow estimates for P. taeda were high, ranging from two to six migrants per generation per population. Cross-validation using Mississippi and Alabama samples supported the gene flow patterns, showing an admixture at the juncture of the Mississippi River Valley. Lower allelic diversity in the western range of P. taeda and higher number of diagnostic alleles in the eastern range are attributed to (1) a prevailing wind direction which facilitates viable pollen movement from west to east, and (2) a gradual contraction in western P. taeda population sizes over the past 5000–8000 years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Al-Rabab’ah","given":"M.

  {"id":"AlexanderEtAl_2009","abstract":"Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Alexander","given":"David H."},{"family":"Novembre","given":"John"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"AlexanderEtAl_2009","container-title":"Genome Research","container-title-short":"Genome Res.","DOI":"10.1101/gr.094052.109","ISSN":"1088-9051, 1549-5469","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,9]]},"language":"en","page":"1655-1664","PMID":"19648217","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genome.cshlp.org","title":"Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/9/1655","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"AndersonEtAl_2017","abstract":"Next-generation sequencing is becoming increasingly accessible to researchers asking biosystematic questions, but current best practice in both choosing a specific approach and effectively analysing the resulting data set is still being explored. We present a case study for the use of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to resolve relationships in a species complex of Australian arid and semi-arid grasses (Triodia R.Br.), highlighting our solutions to methodological challenges in the use of GBS data. We merged overlapping paired-end reads then optimised locus assembly in the program PyRAD to generate GBS data sets for phylogenetic and distance-based analyses. In addition to traditional concatenation analyses in RAxML, we also demonstrate the novel use of summary species tree analyses (taking gene trees as input) with GBS loci. We found that while species tree analyses were relatively robust to variation in PyRAD assembly parameters, our RAxML analyses resulted in well-supported but conflicting topologies under different assembly settings. Despite this conflict, multiple clades in the complex were consistently supported as distinct across analyses. Our GBS data assembly and analyses improve the resolution of taxa and phylogenetic relationships in the Triodia basedowii complex compared to our previous study based on Sanger sequencing of nuclear (ITS/ETS) and chloroplast (rps16-trnK spacer) markers. The genomic results also partly support previous evidence for hybridization between species in the complex. Our methodological insights for analysing GBS data will assist researchers using similar data to resolve phylogenetic relationships within species complexes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Thiele","given":"Kevin R."},{"family":"Krauss","given":"Siegfried L."},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Matthew D."}],"citation-key":"AndersonEtAl_2017","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0171053","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,30]]},"language":"en","page":"e0171053","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Genotyping-by-Sequencing in a Species Complex of Australian Hummock Grasses (Triodia): Methodological Insights and Phylogenetic Resolution","title-short":"Genotyping-by-Sequencing in a Species Complex of Australian Hummock Grasses (Triodia)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171053","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"AngeloniEtAl_2011","abstract":"Inbreeding is common in plants and can have considerable effects on population viability, because of inbreeding depression. Understanding what determines the magnitude of inbreeding depression is of fundamental importance for conservation biology. We used meta-analysis of 116 studies and 107 plant species to investigate the effects of population size, test environment, life history characteristics and stage on the magnitude of inbreeding depression in 13 different fitness traits. We found that inbreeding depression levels significantly increase with population size. This may be a consequence of either, or both, a higher baseline of the level of inbreeding or increased impact of purging in small populations; unfortunately the available data did not allow distinguishing between these potential explanations. In general, inbreeding depression was found to be common across species and environments, and was significant in all traits examined. Yet, the magnitude of inbreeding depression was significantly influenced by plant longevity and life-history stage, and varied depending on how plant fitness was measured. Our findings highlight the fundamental role of population size in influencing the magnitude of inbreeding depression in plants. This clearly has important implications for conservation biology. Moreover, our findings on the overall generality of inbreeding depression confirm that inbreeding depression is one of the key factors reducing plant population fitness and viability. Hence, we need a better understanding on the architecture of inbreeding depression, how different ecological and historical conditions influence the levels of inbreeding depression in natural plant populations, and its impacts on community dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Angeloni","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Ouborg","given":"N.

While niche shifts have been detected in individual invasive species, one assessment of ~50 plants in Europe and North America concluded that niche shifts were rare, while another concluded the opposite. These contradictory findings, limited in species number and geographic scope, leave open a need to understand how often introduced species experience niche shifts and whether niche shifts can be predicted. We found evidence of climatic niche shifts in 65–100% of 815 terrestrial plant species introduced across five continents, depending on how niche shifts were measured. Individual species responses were idiosyncratic, but we generally saw that niche shifts reflected changes in climate availability at the continent scale and were largest in long-lived and cultivated species. Smaller intercontinental niche shifts occurred within species’ native ranges. Overall, the climatic niches of terrestrial plant species were not conserved as they crossed continents. These results have major consequences for applying environmental niche models to assess the risk of invasive species and for predicting species responses to climate change.

We hypothesized that establishment and survival would be higher in treatments with greater disturbance. At the better-drained location, overall establishment was 15 ± 1% [mean ± standard error] and did not differ among treatments. At the poorly drained location, establishment varied by treatment; mowed and control plots had greater establishment [10 ± 2%] than herbicide + tillage and herbicide-only plots [1.6 ± 0.5%]. Of those seedlings that emerged, overall survival was high at both locations (70–84%). Similarly, total (above + belowground) biomass was greater in herbicide + tillage and herbicide-only plots than in mowed and control plots at both locations. Thus, V. rossicum was successful in establishing and surviving across a range of disturbance regimens particularly relative to other old field species, but growth was greater in more disturbed treatments. The relatively high-establishment rates in old field habitats help explain the invasiveness of this Vincetoxicum species in the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Averill","given":"Kristine M."},{"family":"DiTommaso","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Mohler","given":"Charles L."},{"family":"Milbrath","given":"Lindsey R."}],"citation-key":"AverillEtAl_2010","container-title":"Plant Ecology","container-title-short":"Plant Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/s11258-010-9773-2","ISSN":"1573-5052","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"65-77","source":"Springer Link","title":"Establishment of the invasive perennial Vincetoxicum rossicum across a disturbance gradient in New York State, USA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11258-010-9773-2","volume":"211"},

  {"id":"BahnMcGill_2007","abstract":"Aim Distribution modelling relates sparse data on species occurrence or abundance to environmental information to predict the population of a species at any point in space. Recently, the importance of spatial autocorrelation in distributions has been recognized. Spatial autocorrelation can be categorized as exogenous (stemming from autocorrelation in the underlying variables) or endogenous (stemming from activities of the organism itself, such as dispersal). Typically, one asks whether spatial models explain additional variability (endogenous) in comparison to a fully specified habitat model. We turned this question around and asked: can habitat models explain additional variation when spatial structure is accounted for in a fully specified spatially explicit model? The aim was to find out to what degree habitat models may be inadvertently capturing spatial structure rather than true explanatory mechanisms. Location We used data from 190 species of the North American Breeding Bird Survey covering the conterminous United States and southern Canada. Methods We built 13 different models on 190 bird species using regression trees. Our habitat-based models used climate and landcover variables as independent variables. We also used random variables and simulated ranges to validate our results. The two spatially explicit models included only geographical coordinates or a contagion term as independent variables. As another angle on the question of mechanism vs. spatial structure we pitted a model using related bird species as predictors against a model using randomly selected bird species. Results The spatially explicit models outperformed the traditional habitat models and the random predictor species outperformed the related predictor species. In addition, environmental variables produced a substantial R2 in predicting artificial ranges. Main conclusions We conclude that many explanatory variables with suitable spatial structure can work well in species distribution models. The predictive power of environmental variables is not necessarily mechanistic, and spatial interpolation can outperform environmental explanatory variables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bahn","given":"Volker"},{"family":"McGill","given":"Brian J."}],"citation-key":"BahnMcGill_2007","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00331.x","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00331.x","page":"733-742","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Can niche-based distribution models outperform spatial interpolation?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00331.x","volume":"16"},

Accounting for changes in climatic niche over time may provide better understanding of the dynamic biological invasion process. We investigated these changes for an invasive alien plant Mikania micrantha in South and Southeast Asia, Australia, Oceania and parts of the USA. Based on documented occurrences over 200 years (1800-2017), we reconstructed the introduction history of the species and estimated climatic niche dynamics for the presumed invasion routes. We estimated niche conservatism and the environmental analogy between native and invasive ranges and used ecological niche modelling to identify the potential distribution of M. micrantha under current and future climate change scenarios. Our study identified six pathways through which the species was presumably introduced from its native range. Climatic conditions of the initial introduction sites were found to be similar to those in the native niche. However, the species occupied climatic niches in dry and cold areas over time, being outside of the limits of the realized climatic niche of its native range. The climatic niche dynamics also differed between the invasion pathways with variable time lag. This pattern of niche change over time was found to be consistent in future. Nearly 20% of the invasive range was found to be climatically suitable for this species and was predicted to expand towards cold and dry areas of the invasive range affecting nearly half of the global biodiversity hotspots. By analyzing M. micrantha invasion at a time scale, this study revealed multiple introduction pathways, variation in climatic niche dynamics among invasion routes, and potential range expansion of the species in its invasive range. Although further experimental and molecular studies are needed to explain these findings fully, this study highlights the need for temporally explicit approaches towards better understanding and successful management of biological invasions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Achyut Kumar"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Wuxia"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yelin"}],"citation-key":"BanerjeeEtAl_2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

Temporal projection of potential distributions is complicated by the magnitude and pace of changing climate, which could alter suitability under future conditions. The wetland invader, Butomus umbellatus is widespread in the northern US and southern Canada, but potential for invasion into new areas is unknown. We used environmental niche modeling to address our hypotheses for B. umbellatus: (1) a climatic niche shift has occurred between native and invasive ranges, (2) suitable areas in the invaded range have been colonized, and (3) climate suitability is likely to change in future climates. Environmental niche is highly conserved and stable (0.761) between ranges of B. umbellatus. Ensemble forecast revealed that nearly 60% of the invaded range is climatically suitable, including large areas in both the southern US and Alaska. Under future climates, there is a net decrease of suitable area, although two of three global circulation models predict range expansion of this species across gas emission scenarios.

  {"id":"Barbet-MassinEtAl_2018","abstract":"Predictive studies are of paramount importance for biological invasions, one of the biggest threats for biodiversity. To help and better prioritize management strategies, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to predict the potential invasive range of introduced species. Yet, SDMs have been regularly criticized, due to several strong limitations, such as violating the equilibrium assumption during the invasion process. Unfortunately, validation studies–with independent data–are too scarce to assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in invasion biology. Yet, biological invasions allow to test SDMs usefulness, by retrospectively assessing whether they would have accurately predicted the latest ranges of invasion. Here, we assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in predicting the expansion of invasive species. We used temporal occurrence data for the Asian hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax, a species native to China that is invading Europe with a very fast rate. Specifically, we compared occurrence data from the last stage of invasion (independent validation points) to the climate suitability distribution predicted from models calibrated with data from the early stage of invasion. Despite the invasive species not being at equilibrium yet, the predicted climate suitability of validation points was high. SDMs can thus adequately predict the spread of V. v. nigrithorax, which appears to be—at least partially–climatically driven. In the case of V. v. nigrithorax, SDMs predictive accuracy was slightly but significantly better when models were calibrated with invasive data only, excluding native data. Although more validation studies for other invasion cases are needed to generalize our results, our findings are an important step towards validating the use of SDMs in invasion biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Barbet-Massin","given":"Morgane"},{"family":"Rome","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Villemant","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Courchamp","given":"Franck"}],"citation-key":"Barbet-MassinEtAl_2018","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0193085","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,6]]},"language":"en","page":"e0193085","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Can species distribution models really predict the expansion of invasive species?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193085","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"BellEtAl_2009","abstract":"Expressed sequence tag – polymerase chain reaction (EST-PCR) molecular markers were used to infer spatial genetic structure of four lowbush blueberry ( Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.) fields in Maine. Genetic structure was quantified at three spatial scales: (1) within apparent clones (intrapatch), (2) among clones within a field, and (3) among fields separated by as much as 65 km. Of five “clones” or putative individuals examined in the intrapatch study, two showed complete genetic homogeneity within the patch, while three showed some band differences at their edges compared with their interiors. These differences at the edges, however, matched adjacent clones (so-called “intruders”), from which it was concluded that lowbush blueberry exhibits a fairly tight, phalanx clonal architecture with no evidence of invasive seedling establishment within clones. No significant correlation between genetic and physical distance was found among clones within fields via several statistical approaches. Significant among-field genetic differentiation was found via AMOVA (Φ \n              PT \n              = 8.4%; p ≤ 0.01) based upon transect samples across four fields ranging from 12.5 to 65 km apart. Principal component analysis and spatial autocorrelation (SA) corroborated these findings. Significant positive SA was found at the within-field distance class of <350 m, but SA decreased to an insignificant value by the first interfield distance of 12.5 km. A special form of SA analysis was employed to detect “hotspots” of genetic similarity between pairs of adjacent clones in two fields. Results indicated that 5 of 23 pairs of clones (21.7%) were genetically similar to each other, while the majority of pairs (18 of 23; 78.3%) showed random, decreasing patterns of genetic similarity.

  {"id":"BianchiEtAl_2017","abstract":"Hemispherical photography (HP), implemented with cameras equipped with “fisheye” lenses, is a widely used method for describing forest canopies and light regimes. A promising technological advance is the availability of low-cost fisheye lenses for smartphone cameras. However, smartphone camera sensors cannot record a full hemisphere. We investigate whether smartphone HP is a cheaper and faster but still adequate operational alternative to traditional cameras for describing forest canopies and light regimes. We collected hemispherical pictures with both smartphone and traditional cameras in 223 forest sample points, across different overstory species and canopy densities. The smartphone image acquisition followed a faster and simpler protocol than that for the traditional camera. We automatically thresholded all images. We processed the traditional camera images for Canopy Openness (CO) and Site Factor estimation. For smartphone images, we took two pictures with different orientations per point and used two processing protocols: (i) we estimated and averaged total canopy gap from the two single pictures, and (ii) merging the two pictures together, we formed images closer to full hemispheres and estimated from them CO and Site Factors. We compared the same parameters obtained from different cameras and estimated generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) between them. Total canopy gap estimated from the first processing protocol for smartphone pictures was on average significantly higher than CO estimated from traditional camera images, although with a consistent bias. Canopy Openness and Site Factors estimated from merged smartphone pictures of the second processing protocol were on average significantly higher than those from traditional cameras images, although with relatively little absolute differences and scatter. Smartphone HP is an acceptable alternative to HP using traditional cameras, providing similar results with a faster and cheaper methodology. Smartphone outputs can be directly used as they are for ecological studies, or converted with specific models for a better comparison to traditional cameras.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Bianchi","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Cahalan","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Hale","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Gibbons","given":"James Michael"}],"citation-key":"BianchiEtAl_2017","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.3567","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.3567","page":"10556-10566","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Rapid assessment of forest canopy and light regime using smartphone hemispherical photography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.3567","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"BoyceEtAl_2002","abstract":"A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyce","given":"Mark S"},{"family":"Vernier","given":"Pierre R"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Scott E"},{"family":"Schmiegelow","given":"Fiona K.

In this study, eight prioritisation criteria were used along with different prioritisation systems and applied to the Portuguese CWR and WHP. The top 50 species obtained by each of these methods were identified. The final top CWR were those that occurred as a priority in most methods. Twenty CWR were identified as the highest priorities for conservation in Portugal and they include wild relatives of the crop genera Allium, Daucus, Dianthus, Epilobium, Festuca, Herniaria, Narcissus, Quercus, Plantago, Trifolium, and Vicia.

  {"id":"BriscoeRunquistEtAl_2019","abstract":"Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) is an annual plant native to the desert Southwest of the United States and Mexico and has become invasive and caused large economic losses across much of the United States. In order to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of past invasion, and to predict future invasion, we developed a broad array of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, we constructed sequential SDMs throughout the invasion history and asked how well those predicted future invasion (1970 to present). We showed that invasion occurred from a restricted set of environments in the native range to a diverse set in the invaded range. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that rapid range expansion was facilitated by stochastic, long-distance dispersal events. Regardless of SDM approach, all SDMs built using datasets from early in the invasion (1970–2010) performed poorly and failed to predict most of the current invaded range. Together, these results suggest that climate is unlikely to have influenced early stages of range expansion. SDMs that incorporated data from the most recent sampling (2011–2017) performed considerably better, predicted high suitability in regions that have recently become invaded, and identified mean annual temperature as a key factor limiting northward range expansion. Under future climates, models predicted both further northward range expansion and significantly increased suitability across large portions of the U.S. Overall, our results indicate significant challenges for SDMs of invasive species far from climate equilibrium. However, our models based on recent data make more robust predictions for northward range expansion of A. palmeri with climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Briscoe Runquist","given":"Ryan D."},{"family":"Lake","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Tiffin","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Moeller","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"BriscoeRunquistEtAl_2019","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-38054-9","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,20]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"2426","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Species distribution models throughout the invasion history of Palmer amaranth predict regions at risk of future invasion and reveal challenges with modeling rapidly shifting geographic ranges","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38054-9","volume":"9"},

We show with robust cross-continental data that a shift of the observed climatic niche occurred between native and non-native ranges, providing the first empirical evidence that an invasive species can occupy climatically distinct niche spaces following its introduction into a new area.

  {"id":"BroennimannEtAl_2012","abstract":"Aim Concerns over how global change will influence species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in evolutionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data. Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geographical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space to multivariate environmental space independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space. However, the use of ordination and species distribution model techniques for selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrasting results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographical distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Broennimann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Matthew C."},{"family":"Pearman","given":"Peter B."},{"family":"Petitpierre","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"Pellissier","given":"Loïc"},{"family":"Yoccoz","given":"Nigel G."},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Fortin","given":"Marie-Josée"},{"family":"Randin","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Niklaus E."},{"family":"Graham","given":"Catherine H."},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"}],"citation-key":"BroennimannEtAl_2012","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00698.x","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00698.x","page":"481-497","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Measuring ecological niche overlap from occurrence and spatial environmental data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00698.x","volume":"21"},

Wild populations face threats both from deterministic factors, e.g., habitat loss, overexploitation, pollution, and introduced species, and from stochastic events of a demographic, genetic, and environmental nature, including catastrophes. Inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness in naturally outbreeding species, but its role in extinctions of wild populations is controversial. To evaluate critically the role of inbreeding in extinction, we conducted realistic population viability analyses of 20 threatened species, with and without inbreeding depression, using initial population sizes of 50, 250, and 1000. Inbreeding markedly decreased median times to extinction by 28.5, 30.5, and 25% for initial populations of 50, 250, and 1000, respectively, and the impacts were similar across major taxa. The major variable explaining differences among species was initial population growth rate, whereas the impact of inbreeding was least in species with negative growth rates. These results demonstrate that the prospects for survival of threatened species will usually be seriously overestimated if genetic factors are disregarded, and that inappropriate recovery plans may be instituted if inbreeding depression is ignored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Brook","given":"Barry W."},{"family":"Tonkyn","given":"David W."},{"family":"O'Grady","given":"Julian J."},{"family":"Frankham","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"BrookEtAl_2002","container-title":"Conservation Ecology","ISSN":"1195-5449","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"publisher":"Resilience Alliance Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"Contribution of inbreeding to extinction risk in threatened species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26271855","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"Brown_1984","abstract":"There appears to be a general relationship between abundance and distribution that has two parts. First, within species, population density tends to be greatest in the center of the range and to decline gradually toward the boundaries. This pattern holds over a range of spatial scales from steep environmental gradients within local regions to the entire geographic range. Exceptions include: (1) abrupt changes in abundance that usually correspond to sharp, discontinuous changes in single environmental variables; and (2) multimodal patterns of abundance that are caused by environmental patchiness. The second general relationship is that among closely related, ecologically similar species spatial distribution is positively correlated with average abundance. Again this pattern holds over a variety of spatial scales from local regions to entire geographic ranges. These empirical patterns have already been reported in the literature, but their generality is demonstrated by analysis of additional data for diverse kinds of organisms. A single general theory accounts for these observations and follows logically from three assumptions. First, the abundance and distribution of each species are limited by the combination of physical and biotic environmental variables that determines the multidimensional niche. Second, spatial variation in these environmental variables is somewhat stochastic but autocorrelated, so that nearby sites tend to have more similar environmental conditions than more distant ones. Third, closely related, ecologically similar species differ in no more than a very few niche dimensions. A more formal model can be developed that predicts that under these assumptions the distribution of population density over space should approximate a normal probability density distribution. Most exceptions to this predicted pattern can be explained as cases in which assumptions of the model are clearly violated. This paper represents an example of a statistical approach that should be useful for investigating complex ecological systems comprised of many components, such as species of many individuals or communities of many species. The general relationships between abundance and distribution developed here eventually should contribute to our understanding of the biogeography, population genetics, and evolution of species as well as the ecological attributes of populations and communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"James H."}],"citation-key":"Brown_1984","container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/284267","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1984,8,1]]},"page":"255-279","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"On the relationship between abundance and distribution of species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/284267","volume":"124"},

The findings contribute to our general understanding of pollination ecology at high latitudes and provide important information for the commercialization of cloudberry. Female flowers were smaller than males but provided more nectar, although this resource was low in both sexes. Insects from 43 families visited cloudberry flowers, yet four families (Apidae, Halictidae, Muscidae, Syrphidae) represented ca. 87% of all visitors observed. Introduction experiments revealed that apids and muscids are significantly poorer pollinators (based on fruit production) than halictids and syrphids, but when fruit mass or seed set was considered, there were no significant differences between families. Pollinator importance, a product of flower visitation frequency and seed set effectiveness, revealed that the dipterans were of paramount importance to the pollination of cloudberry. Furthermore, they are limited to cloudberry because their lapping mouthparts exclude them from accessing the nutritional rewards of competing Ericaceae flowers. While the total number of pollinator families observed suggest a generalist pollination system, if one considers the dominant pollinators (flies) as a functional group, then this insect–flower relationship could be considered a specialized one.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Adam O."},{"family":"McNeil","given":"Jeremy N."}],"citation-key":"BrownMcNeil_2009","container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.3732/ajb.0800102","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.0800102","page":"1096-1107","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Pollination ecology of the high latitude, dioecious cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus; Rosaceae)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.0800102","volume":"96"},

A large number of species-at-risk in Canada are at the northern edge of their distribution, and many of these live in fragmented habitat. We used nuclear and chloroplast markers to assess patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation within and among populations of Canadian Magnolia acuminata (Cucumber tree), an endangered species in Canada that extends as far north as the fragmented Carolinian forest in southern Ontario. We also compared the genetic composition of Canadian M. acuminata to populations sampled throughout its central distribution in the USA. We found a high proportion of shared microsatellite alleles, plus a single cpDNA haplotype, distributed throughout the entire M. acuminata range. We also found that despite occupying fragmented habitat at their range periphery, Canadian populations showed little reduction in genetic diversity relative to the USA populations, and we attribute this to effective historical dispersal in a long-lived, polyploid species. However, a combination of private alleles, genetic substructuring, and lower levels of genetic diversity in seedlings compared to mature trees, suggests that current levels of gene flow are relatively low among Canadian populations. Therefore, despite high levels of genetic diversity in Canadian M. acuminata, managers should be aware that without intervention, populations will likely become increasingly isolated and experience a reduction in genetic diversity which in turn may threaten their long-term survival in Canada.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Budd","given":"Cara"},{"family":"Zimmer","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Freeland","given":"Joanna R."}],"citation-key":"BuddEtAl_2015","container-title":"Conservation Genetics","container-title-short":"Conserv Genet","DOI":"10.1007/s10592-015-0746-9","ISSN":"1572-9737","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1359-1373","source":"Springer Link","title":"Conservation genetics of Magnolia acuminata, an endangered species in Canada: Can genetic diversity be maintained in fragmented, peripheral populations?","title-short":"Conservation genetics of Magnolia acuminata, an endangered species in Canada","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10592-015-0746-9","volume":"16"},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the magnitude of inbreeding depression in self-incompatible and self-compatible populations of Leavenworthia alabamica. Within-population crosses were conducted to compare the quantity and quality of offspring produced by outcrossing and self-fertilization. These progeny were grown in a common greenhouse and inbreeding depression was measured in germination, survival, biomass, transition rate to flowering, flower number, petal length, pollen grains/anther, pollen viability, and ovule number. In comparison to outcrossing, self-fertilization led to the production of fewer and smaller seeds within self-incompatible populations. Moreover, inbreeding depression was observed in eight of 11 offspring traits within self-incompatible populations of L. alabamica. In contrast, there was significant inbreeding depression only in flower number within self-compatible populations. The results of this study are consistent with the idea that self-fertilization selectively removes partially recessive deleterious alleles causing inbreeding depression in natural plant populations. However, in plant species such as L. alabamica where self-compatibility may evolve in small populations following long-distance dispersal, declines in inbreeding depression may also be facilitated by genetic drift.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Busch","given":"J.

  {"id":"CainEtAl_2000","abstract":"Long-distance seed dispersal influences many key aspects of the biology of plants, including spread of invasive species, metapopulation dynamics, and diversity and dynamics in plant communities. However, because long-distance seed dispersal is inherently hard to measure, there are few data sets that characterize the tails of seed dispersal curves. This paper is structured around two lines of argument. First, we argue that long-distance seed dispersal is of critical importance and, hence, that we must collect better data from the tails of seed dispersal curves. To make the case for the importance of long-distance seed dispersal, we review existing data and models of long-distance seed dispersal, focusing on situations in which seeds that travel long distances have a critical impact (colonization of islands, Holocene migrations, response to global change, metapopulation biology). Second, we argue that genetic methods provide a broadly applicable way to monitor long-distance seed dispersal; to place this argument in context, we review genetic estimates of plant migration rates. At present, several promising genetic approaches for estimating long-distance seed dispersal are under active development, including assignment methods, likelihood methods, genealogical methods, and genealogical/demographic methods. We close the paper by discussing important but as yet largely unexplored areas for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Cain","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Milligan","given":"Brook G."},{"family":"Strand","given":"Allan E."}],"citation-key":"CainEtAl_2000","container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.2307/2656714","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/2656714","page":"1217-1227","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Long-distance seed dispersal in plant populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2656714","volume":"87"},

This historic bias appears to be changing with multiple active research and release programs. Similarly, biocontrol workers appear to avoid targeting species with native congeners. These biases appear inappropriate as the ecological and entomological literature provide abundant evidence for sub-genus specificity for many herbivores, including those attacking grasses. The biocontrol program targeting Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud (Poaceae) provides an informative example with endemic subspecies in North America and many sub-genus specific herbivores, including potential European control agents. Grasses and target weeds with congeneric native species require rigorous host range testing, similar to all other targets in current weed biological control programs. Furthermore, it appears prudent to ask petition reviewers and regulatory agencies to abandon their focus on results of no-choice studies and to distinguish between trivial feeding and demographic impacts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Casagrande","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Häfliger","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Hinz","given":"Hariet L."},{"family":"Tewksbury","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Blossey","given":"Bernd"}],"citation-key":"CasagrandeEtAl_2018","container-title":"BioControl","container-title-short":"BioControl","DOI":"10.1007/s10526-018-9871-y","ISSN":"1573-8248","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"391-403","source":"Springer Link","title":"Grasses as appropriate targets in weed biocontrol: is the common reed, Phragmites australis, an anomaly?","title-short":"Grasses as appropriate targets in weed biocontrol","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10526-018-9871-y","volume":"63"},

However, their conservation status and availability for utilization are a concern, and have not been quantified globally. Here, we model the global distribution of 1,076 taxa related to 81 crops, using occurrence information collected from biodiversity, herbarium and gene bank databases. We compare the potential geographic and ecological diversity encompassed in these distributions with that currently accessible in gene banks, as a means to estimate the comprehensiveness of the conservation of genetic diversity. Our results indicate that the diversity of crop wild relatives is poorly represented in gene banks. For 313 (29.1% of total) taxa associated with 63 crops, no germplasm accessions exist, and a further 257 (23.9%) are represented by fewer than ten accessions. Over 70% of taxa are identified as high priority for further collecting in order to improve their representation in gene banks, and over 95% are insufficiently represented in regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. The most critical collecting gaps occur in the Mediterranean and the Near East, western and southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America.

  {"id":"CastoeEtAl_2012","abstract":"Identification of microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), can be a time-consuming and costly investment requiring enrichment, cloning, and sequencing of candidate loci. Recently, however, high throughput sequencing (with or without prior enrichment for specific SSR loci) has been utilized to identify SSR loci. The direct “Seq-to-SSR” approach has an advantage over enrichment-based strategies in that it does not require a priori selection of particular motifs, or prior knowledge of genomic SSR content. It has been more expensive per SSR locus recovered, however, particularly for genomes with few SSR loci, such as bird genomes. The longer but relatively more expensive 454 reads have been preferred over less expensive Illumina reads. Here, we use Illumina paired-end sequence data to identify potentially amplifiable SSR loci (PALs) from a snake (the Burmese python, Python molurus bivittatus), and directly compare these results to those from 454 data. We also compare the python results to results from Illumina sequencing of two bird genomes (Gunnison Sage-grouse, Centrocercus minimus, and Clark's Nutcracker, Nucifraga columbiana), which have considerably fewer SSRs than the python. We show that direct Illumina Seq-to-SSR can identify and characterize thousands of potentially amplifiable SSR loci for as little as $10 per sample – a fraction of the cost of 454 sequencing. Given that Illumina Seq-to-SSR is effective, inexpensive, and reliable even for species such as birds that have few SSR loci, it seems that there are now few situations for which prior hybridization is justifiable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Castoe","given":"Todd A."},{"family":"Poole","given":"Alexander W."},{"family":"Koning","given":"A.

  {"id":"CattonEtAl_2016","abstract":"Understanding the impact of herbivory on plant populations is a fundamental goal of ecology. Damage to individual plants can be visually striking and affect the fates of individuals, but these impacts do not necessarily translate into population-level differences in vital rates (survival, growth, or fecundity) or population growth rates. In biological control of weeds, quantitative assessments of population-level impacts of released agents on both target invasive plants and native, nontarget plants are needed to inform evaluations of the benefits and risks of releasing agents into new regions. Here we present a 3-yr experimental demographic field study using the European root-feeding biocontrol weevil, Mogulones crucifer, first released in Canada in 1997 to control the invasive weed Cynoglossum officinale (Boraginaceae). Mogulones crucifer is an effective “search and destroy” agent in Canada, but sporadically feeds, oviposits, and develops on native nontarget Boraginaceae. We investigated the population-level impacts of this biocontrol insect on its target weed and a native nontarget plant, Hackelia micrantha (Boraginaceae), by releasing large numbers of weevils into naturally occurring patches of H. micrantha growing isolated from or interspersed with C. officinale. We followed the fates of individual plants on release and nonrelease (control) sites for two transition years, developed matrix models to project population growth rates (λ) for each plant species, and examined the contributions from differences in vital rates to changes in λ using life table response experiments (LTRE). In contrast to studies of the insect–plant interaction in its native range, as a biocontrol agent, M. crucifer increased mortality of C. officinale rosettes in the year immediately following release, depressing the weed's λ to below the population replacement level. However, λ for H. micrantha was never depressed below the replacement level, and any differences between release and nonrelease sites in the nontarget could not be explained by significant contributions from vital rates in the LTRE. This study is the first to simultaneously and experimentally examine target and nontarget population-level impacts of a weed biocontrol insect in the field, and supports the theoretical prediction that plant life history characteristics and uneven herbivore host preferences can interact to produce differences in population-level impacts between target and nontarget plant species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Catton","given":"Haley A."},{"family":"Lalonde","given":"Robert G."},{"family":"Buckley","given":"Yvonne M."},{"family":"Clerck‐Floate","given":"Rosemarie A.

The volume, whose chapters bring together a large cross-section of the biodiversity community engaged in these methods, attempts to establish a common language across disciplines for understanding and implementing remote sensing of biodiversity across scales. The first part of the book offers a potential basis for remote detection of biodiversity. An overview of the nature of biodiversity is described, along with ways for determining traits of plant biodiversity through spectral analyses across spatial scales and linking spectral data to the tree of life. The second part details what can be detected spectrally and remotely. Specific instrumentation and technologies are described, as well as the technical challenges of detection and data synthesis, collection and processing. The third part discusses spatial resolution and integration across scales and ends with a vision for developing a global biodiversity monitoring system.

The present study addresses the relationships of the major clades in Boraginaceae s.str. with an emphasis on monophyly of, and relationships between previously recognized clades and the position of various unplaced genera such as Afrotysonia, Anoplocaryum, Brachybotrys, Chionocharis, Craniospermum, Thyrocarpus, and Trigonocaryum using three plastid markers and a taxon sampling with four outgroup and 170 ingroup species from 73 genera. The phylogeny shows high statistical support for most nodes on the backbone and within individual clades. Echiochileae are confirmed as sister to the remainder of Boraginaceae s.str., which, in turn, fall into two well-supported clades, the Boragineae + Lithospermeae and the Cynoglosseae s.l. The latter is highly resolved and includes the Lasiocaryum-clade (Chionocharis, Lasiocaryum, Microcaryum) and the Trichodesmeae (Caccinia, Trichodesma) as sister to the remainder of the group. Rochelieae (formerly the Eritrichieae s.str., also including Eritrichium, Hackelia, and Lappula) form a poorly supported polytomy together with the Mertensia-clade (also including Anoplocaryum, Asperugo, and Memoremea) and the Omphalodes-clade. The enigmatic genus Craniospermum (Craniospermeae) is sister to an expanded Myosotideae (also including Brachybotrys, Decalepidanthus, Trigonocaryum, and Trigonotis) and these two clades are in turn sister to the Core-Cynoglosseae, in which Afrotysonia glochidiata and Thyrocarpus sampsonii are included. Core-Cynoglosseae again fall into two pairs of well-supported subclades. The majority of generic placements are now resolved satisfactorily and the remaining phylogenetic questions can be clearly delimited.

A population's probability of extinction is directly correlated with its variability and inversely correlated with density and immigration rate5,6,7,8,9. This has led to the prediction that, when a species becomes endangered, its geographical range should contract inwards, with the core populations persisting until the final stages of decline2,10.

Hieracium lepidulum is an invasive weed in New Zealand, colonising a diverse range of habitats including native Nothofagus forest, pine plantations, scrubland and tussock grassland. It is competing with native subalpine and alpine grassland and herbfield vegetation. H. lepidulum is a triploid, diplosporous apomict, so theoretically all seed is clonal, and there is limited potential for the creation of variation through recombination. We used intersimple sequence repeats (ISSRs) to determine the population genetic structure of New Zealand populations of H. lepidulum. ISSR analysis of five populations from two regions in the South Island demonstrated high intrapopulation genotypic diversity, and high interpopulation genetic structuring; ΦST=0.54 over all five populations. No private alleles were found in any of the five populations, and allelic differentiation was correlated to geographic distance. Cladistic compatibility analysis indicated that both recombination and mutation were important in the creation of genotypic diversity.

  {"id":"CharlesRicouEtAl_2014","abstract":"Conservation of pollinator abundance and diversity is an important issue because it contributes to main-taining a diverse community of plant species in agroecosystems. The presence of semi-natural areasfavorable to pollination is a key factor for achieving this objective of sustainability. Sowing mixtures ofdicotyledonous plants that are rich in pollen and nectar as flower strips along field margins is an efficientsolution to attract pollinators and to support their foraging activity on arable land. The enhancement ofagroecosystems requires operational methods that make it possible to assess the impact of existing andsown semi-natural areas on pollination. We developed here a new predictive indicator that can be usedat the field margin and floral levels, which predicts the pollination value of floral diversity and abundanceof field margins on arable land.We based the predictive indicator on decision trees using “if-then” linguistic rules because of the lackof sufficient quantitative knowledge about the relationships between floral traits and pollination. Thisapproach makes it possible to use quantitative and qualitative information. We associated fuzzy subsetsto the decision trees and the classes of variables in order to avoid the knife-edge effect of class limits. Atthe species level, the indicator depends on three criteria: (i) visual attractiveness in terms of flower size,color and UV reflection; (ii) flower accessibility according to the botanical family, the symmetry and theshape of the flower; and (iii) the reward linked to pollen and nectar quantity and quality. An aggregationprocedure allows us to obtain a value at the field margin level for each month as a function of theflowering period and pollination activity.

  {"id":"Clerck-FloateSchwarzlander_2002","abstract":"Recent concerns over the safety of native North American plant species in the family Boraginaceae, especially those of endangered status in the USA, prompted additional host specificity testing of the European root weevil Mogulones cruciger , a proposed agent for the biocontrol of houndstongue in the USA. M. cruciger can complete full development on species within closely-related genera in the Boraginaceae, but prefers houndstongue as a host. Of the 22 species of native North American Boraginaceae that were tested in this study, nine species from four genera within the tribe Eritrichieae ( Cryptantha, Hackelia, Mertensia and Lappula ) clearly supported development of M. cruciger . However, generally these non-target species experienced less attack by M. cruciger relative to houndstongue. There were differences in the incidence and degree of attack depending on the test type, which included the use of potted test plants in laboratory no-choice and open-field choice situations. The least non-target attack occurred on rangeland in British Columbia, Canada, where potted test plants were introduced into sites where the insect had been previously released on houndstongue. These results suggest that M. cruciger has a narrow ecological host range. Special emphasis was placed on testing species of Cryptantha because C. crassipes is listed as endangered in the USA. Six of 12 Cryptantha species tested supported full development, but generally, the incidence and intensity of attack were less for these species relative to houndstongue. There was no, or incomplete development, on tested species of Plagiobothrys , a genus that contains two species listed as endangered in the USA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Clerck-Floate","given":"R.

Pre-modeling analyses include species niche quantifications and comparisons between distinct ranges or time periods, measures of phylogenetic diversity, and other data exploration functionalities (e.g. extrapolation detection, ExDet). Core modeling brings together the new approach of ensemble of small models (ESM) and various implementations of the spatially-explicit modeling of species assemblages (SESAM) framework. Post-modeling analyses include evaluation of species predictions based on presence-only data (Boyce index) and of community predictions, phylogenetic diversity and environmentally-constrained species co-occurrences analyses. The ecospat package also provides some functions to supplement the ‘biomod2’ package (e.g. data preparation, permutation tests and cross-validation of model predictive power). With this novel package, we intend to stimulate the use of comprehensive approaches in spatial modelling of species and community distributions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cola","given":"Valeria Di"},{"family":"Broennimann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Petitpierre","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"Breiner","given":"Frank T."},{"family":"D'Amen","given":"Manuela"},{"family":"Randin","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Engler","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Pottier","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Pio","given":"Dorothea"},{"family":"Dubuis","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Pellissier","given":"Loic"},{"family":"Mateo","given":"Rubén G."},{"family":"Hordijk","given":"Wim"},{"family":"Salamin","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"}],"citation-key":"ColaEtAl_2017","container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/ecog.02671","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecog.02671","page":"774-787","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"ecospat: an R package to support spatial analyses and modeling of species niches and distributions","title-short":"ecospat","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.02671","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"CrnokrakBarrett_2002","abstract":"Abstract.— Inbreeding depression, the reduction in fitness that accompanies inbreeding, is one of the most important topics of research in evolutionary and conservation genetics. In the recent literature, much attention has been paid to the possibility of purging the genetic load. If inbreeding depression is due to deleterious alleles, whose effect on fitness are negative when in a homozygous state, then successive generations of inbreeding may result in a rebound in fitness due to the selective decrease in frequency of deleterious alleles. Here we examine the experimental evidence for purging of the genetic load by collating empirical tests of rebounds in fitness-related traits with inbreeding in animals and plants. We gathered data from 28 studies including five mammal, three insect, one mollusc, and 13 plant species. We tested for purging by examining three measures of fitness-component variation with serial generations of inbreeding: (1) changes in inbreeding depression, (2) changes in fitness components of inbred lines relative to the original outbred line, and (3) purged population (outcrossed inbred lines) trait means as a function of ancestral outbred trait means. Frequent and substantial purging was found using all three measures, but was particularly pronounced when tracking changes in inbreeding depression. Despite this, we found little correspondence between the three measures of purging within individual studies, indicating that the manner in which a researcher chooses to estimate purging will affect interpretation of the results obtained. The discrepancy suggests an alternative hypothesis: rebounds in fitness with inbreeding may have resulted from adaptation to laboratory conditions and not to purging when using outcrossed inbred lines. However, the pronounced reduction in inbreeding depression for a number of studies provides evidence for purging, as the measure is likely less affected by selection for laboratory conditions. Unlike other taxon-specific reviews on this topic, our results provide support for the purging hypothesis, but firm predictions about the situations in which purging is likely or the magnitude of fitness rebound possible when populations are inbred remain difficult. Further research is required to resolve the discrepancy between the results obtained using different experimental approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Crnokrak","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Spencer C.

  {"id":"Crystal-OrnelasEtAl_2021","abstract":"Invasive species can have severe impacts on ecosystems, economies, and human health. Though the economic impacts of invasions provide important foundations for management and policy, up-to-date syntheses of these impacts are lacking. To produce the most comprehensive estimate of invasive species costs within North America (including the Greater Antilles) to date, we synthesized economic impact data from the recently published InvaCost database. Here, we report that invasions have cost the North American economy at least US$ 1.26 trillion between 1960 and 2017. Economic costs have climbed over recent decades, averaging US$ 2 billion per year in the early 1960s to over US$ 26 billion per year in the 2010s. Of the countries within North America, the United States (US) had the highest recorded costs, even after controlling for research effort within each country ($5.81 billion per cost source in the US). Of the taxa and habitats that could be classified in our database, invasive vertebrates were associated with the greatest costs, with terrestrial habitats incurring the highest monetary impacts. In particular, invasive species cumulatively (from 1960–2017) cost the agriculture and forestry sectors US$ 527.07 billion and US$ 34.93 billion, respectively. Reporting issues (e.g., data quality or taxonomic granularity) prevented us from synthesizing data from all available studies. Furthermore, very few of the known invasive species in North America had reported economic costs. Therefore, while the costs to the North American economy are massive, our US$ 1.26 trillion estimate is likely very conservative. Accordingly, expanded and more rigorous economic cost reports are necessary to provide more comprehensive invasion impact estimates, and then support data-based management decisions and actions towards species invasions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Crystal-Ornelas","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Hudgins","given":"Emma J."},{"family":"Cuthbert","given":"Ross N."},{"family":"Haubrock","given":"Phillip J."},{"family":"Fantle-Lepczyk","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Angulo","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Kramer","given":"Andrew M."},{"family":"Ballesteros-Mejia","given":"Liliana"},{"family":"Leroy","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Leung","given":"Brian"},{"family":"López-López","given":"Eugenia"},{"family":"Diagne","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Courchamp","given":"Franck"}],"citation-key":"Crystal-OrnelasEtAl_2021","container-title":"NeoBiota","DOI":"10.3897/neobiota.67.58038","ISSN":"1314-2488","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]]},"language":"en","page":"485-510","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","source":"neobiota.pensoft.net","title":"Economic costs of biological invasions within North America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://neobiota.pensoft.net/article/58038/","volume":"67"},

  {"id":"Debnath_2016","abstract":"Fragaria (strawberry; Rosaceae), Rubus (brambles: raspberry and blackberry; Rosaceae), and Vaccinium (blueberry, cranberry and lingonberry; Ericaceae) are among the most important berry crop genera worldwide. Berry fruits are rich in vitamin C, cellulose, and pectin, and produce anthocyanins which have important therapeutic values, including antitumor, antiulcer, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory activities. As in other crops, biodiversity of berry crops decreased dramatically at the species and intraspecific levels, leading to genetic erosion due to complex process involving both human and environmental drivers. Genetic erosion occurs when old varieties in farmers’ fields are replaced by newer ones. Conservation of genetic resources is of prime importance to prevent genetic erosion. Efforts are being made to conserve the biodiversity of berries across Europe and North America. Utilization of diverse, locally adapted germplasm is required for the future viability of berry production. There is a pressing need to develop reliable methods for conserving, maintaining, and identifying berry germplasm and for assessing genetic biodiversity for practical breeding purposes and proprietary-rights protection. The introduction of molecular biology techniques, such as DNA-based markers, allows direct comparison of different genetic material independent of environmental influences. This paper presents the progress in-depth of various aspects of molecular diversity analyses in wild berry species and cultivars collected from Canada, Europe, and USA. Different molecular markers detected a sufficient degree of polymorphism to differentiate among wild clones and cultivars, making these technologies valuable for cultivar identification and for the more efficient choice of parents in berry breeding programs.

  {"id":"DelisleEtAl_2003","abstract":"Aim To reconstruct the spread of invasive wetland species using herbarium specimens and to develop a method that accounts for the biases associated with this type of historical record. Location Southern Québec. Methods The temporal and spatial distribution of herbarium specimens of vascular plants was examined. Six invasive species that are mainly found in wetlands were compared with five native, non-expanding hydrophytes. The cumulative number of locations was plotted against time to construct invasion curves. For native species, this ‘invasion curve’ indicates the spatiotemporal distribution of the sampling for herbarium specimens of wetland plants. It also represents the history of the state of knowledge of the distribution of native species. Deviation from the native species invasion curve can be used to describe the spread of invasive species. For every year on record, the cumulative number of locations of each exotic species was divided by the cumulative number of locations of all native species, and the proportions obtained were plotted against time. Periods of invasiveness were then delineated. Results During the twentieth century, two periods of intensive herbarium specimen collection in Québec can be clearly distinguished, i.e. from 1930 to 1940 and from 1950 to 1985. Several periods of invasiveness were delineated for Butomus umbellatus L. (1922–35), Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L. (1957–96), Lycopus europaeus L. (1963–2000), Lythrum salicaria L. (1890–1905, 1923–46), Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel (1963–84) and Rorippa amphibia (L.) Bess. (1929–34, 1943–52, 1971–79). Main conclusions Accounting for sampling biases associated with herbarium specimens is important in order to objectively delineate periods of invasiveness for exotic species. The spread of wetland vascular plant species can be reconstructed using herbarium specimens, even when the phenomenon is rapid, but the reconstruction is certainly more accurate when the invasion occurred during an active sampling period. The highly variable sampling effort for herbarium specimens in Québec and in other regions strongly cautions against using herbarium data without correction procedures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Delisle","given":"Fanny"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Claude"},{"family":"Jean","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Lachance","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"DelisleEtAl_2003","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00897.x","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00897.x","page":"1033-1042","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Reconstructing the spread of invasive plants: taking into account biases associated with herbarium specimens","title-short":"Reconstructing the spread of invasive plants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00897.x","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"DiederichsenSchellenberg_2018","abstract":"Canada is home to about 5087 species of higher plants of which 25% were introduced to Canada either deliberately or by accident. The richness of botanical species is highest in the southern, more densely settled parts of the country. About 364 native Canadian species have direct or potential use in crop development for various usages with particular emphasis on use for berries and as forages. The use of more than 600 plant species by indigenous people for food, medicine, or spiritual reasons is documented, and they practiced agriculture prior to colonization by Europeans with cultivations of corn, garden bean, squash, sunflower, and tobacco. Only a few native species are crop wild relatives of major agricultural crops such as 14 species of the genus Helianthus L., which are related to cultivated sunflower. Taxonomists have made major contributions to recognize the potential of the Canadian flora from a utilitarian aspect. Plant breeding in Canada has been done by the government of Canada, by universities, and, more recently, also by the private sector. The focus has been on major crops, while the activities in forages and minor crops have decreased. Canada maintains a national genebank for ex situ conservation (Plant Gene Resources of Canada). More activities to enhance the complementarity between in situ and ex situ conservation should be undertaken in Canada. The potential of native rangeland plants or weeds as genetic resources is emphasized. The “integrating genebank” is suggested as an ambitious concept. In order to maintain the future options Canadian biodiversity holds for enhancing life and livelihoods, a national strategy is required.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Diederichsen","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Schellenberg","given":"Michael P."}],"citation-key":"DiederichsenSchellenberg_2018","container-title":"North American Crop Wild Relatives, Volume 1: Conservation Strategies","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-95101-0_2","editor":[{"family":"Greene","given":"Stephanie L."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Karen A."},{"family":"Khoury","given":"Colin K."},{"family":"Kantar","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Marek","given":"Laura F."}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-95101-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"33-62","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Genetic Resources of Crop Wild Relatives: A Canadian Perspective","title-short":"Genetic Resources of Crop Wild Relatives","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-95101-0_2"},
  {"id":"DietzEdwards_2006","abstract":"Despite intensive research, we still have no general understanding of why plant invasions occur. Many different mechanisms of plant invasions have been proposed, but studies designed to investigate them often produce inconsistent results. It remains unclear whether this unsatisfying state of affairs reflects the complexity of the real world (in which every invasion is unique) or the failure to identify the key processes driving most plant invasions. Here we argue that greater generalization is possible, but only if we recognize that the ecological and evolutionary processes enabling a species to advance into a new area change during the course of an invasion. In our view, an invasion can often usefully be subdivided into a primary phase, in which the abundance of an often preadapted species increases rapidly (typically in resource-rich, disturbed habitats), and a secondary phase, in which further spread is contingent upon plastic responses or genetic adaptation to new ecological circumstances. We present various examples to show how this partitioning of the invasion phase sensu stricto produces new hypotheses about the processes underlying plant invasions. Some of these hypotheses can be conveniently tested by investigating plant invasions along strong environmental gradients such as those that occur in mountainous regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Dietz","given":"Hansjörg"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"DietzEdwards_2006","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1359:RTCPCD]2.0.CO;2","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","page":"1359-1367","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Recognition That Causal Processes Change During Plant Invasion Helps Explain Conflicts in Evidence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9658%282006%2987%5B1359%3ARTCPCD%5D2.0.CO%3B2","volume":"87"},

  {"id":"DormannEtAl_2018","abstract":"Aim Recent studies increasingly use statistical methods to infer biotic interactions from co-occurrence information at a large spatial scale. However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can affect co-occurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge. Approach We present a set of questions that analysts and reviewers should ask to avoid erroneously attributing species association patterns to biotic interactions. Our questions relate to the appropriateness of data and models, the causality behind a correlative signal, and the problems associated with static data from dynamic systems. We summarize caveats reported by macroecological studies of biotic interactions and examine whether conclusions on the presence of biotic interactions are supported by the modelling approaches used. Findings Irrespective of the method used, studies that set out to test for biotic interactions find statistical associations in species’ co-occurrences. Yet, when compared with our list of questions, few purported interpretations of such associations as biotic interactions hold up to scrutiny. This does not dismiss the presence or importance of biotic interactions, but it highlights the risk of too lenient interpretation of the data. Combining model results with information from experiments and functional traits that are relevant for the biotic interaction of interest might strengthen conclusions. Main conclusions Moving from species- to community-level models, including biotic interactions among species, is of great importance for process-based understanding and forecasting ecological responses. We hope that our questions will help to improve these models and facilitate the interpretation of their results. In essence, we conclude that ecologists have to recognize that a species association pattern in joint species distribution models will be driven not only by real biotic interactions, but also by shared habitat preferences, common migration history, phylogenetic history and shared response to missing environmental drivers, which specifically need to be discussed and, if possible, integrated into models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dormann","given":"Carsten F."},{"family":"Bobrowski","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Dehling","given":"D.

We present the co-inertia criterion for measuring the adequacy between two data sets. Co-inertia analysis is based on this criterion as are canonical correspondence analysis or canonical correlation analysis, but the latter two have additional constraints. Co-inertia analysis is very flexible and allows many possibilities for coupling. Co-inertia analysis is suitable for quantitative and/or qualitative or fuzzy environmental variables. Moreover, various weighting of sites and various transformations and/or centering of species data are available for this method. Hence, more ecological considerations can be taken into account in the statistical procedures. Moreover, the principle of this method is very general and can be easily extended to the case of distance matrices or to the case of more than two tables.

Here, we propose a multivariate spatial analysis based on Moran's I (MULTISPATI) by introducing a row-sum standardized spatial weight matrix in the statistical triplet notation.

  {"id":"DufresneEtAl_2014","abstract":"Despite the importance of polyploidy and the increasing availability of new genomic data, there remain important gaps in our knowledge of polyploid population genetics. These gaps arise from the complex nature of polyploid data (e.g. multiple alleles and loci, mixed inheritance patterns, association between ploidy and mating system variation). Furthermore, many of the standard tools for population genetics that have been developed for diploids are often not feasible for polyploids. This review aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in polyploid population genetics and to identify the main areas where further development of molecular techniques and statistical theory is required. We review commonly used molecular tools (amplified fragment length polymorphism, microsatellites, Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing and derived technologies) and their challenges associated with their use in polyploid populations: that is, allele dosage determination, null alleles, difficulty of distinguishing orthologues from paralogues and copy number variation. In addition, we review the approaches that have been used for population genetic analysis in polyploids and their specific problems. These problems are in most cases directly associated with dosage uncertainty and the problem of inferring allele frequencies and assumptions regarding inheritance. This leads us to conclude that for advancing the field of polyploid population genetics, most priority should be given to development of new molecular approaches that allow efficient dosage determination, and to further development of analytical approaches to circumvent dosage uncertainty and to accommodate ‘flexible’ modes of inheritance. In addition, there is a need for more simulation-based studies that test what kinds of biases could result from both existing and novel approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Dufresne","given":"France"},{"family":"Stift","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Vergilino","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Mable","given":"Barbara K."}],"citation-key":"DufresneEtAl_2014","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.12581","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.12581","page":"40-69","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Recent progress and challenges in population genetics of polyploid organisms: an overview of current state-of-the-art molecular and statistical tools","title-short":"Recent progress and challenges in population genetics of polyploid organisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.12581","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"EarlySax_2014","abstract":"Aim Correlative models that forecast extinction risk from climate change and invasion risks following species introductions, depend on the assumption that species' current distributions reflect their climate tolerances (‘climatic equilibrium’). This assumption has rarely been tested with independent distribution data, and studies that have done so have focused on species that are widespread or weedy in their native range. We use independent data to test climatic equilibrium for a broadly representative group of species, and ask whether there are any general indicators that can be used to identify when equilibrium occurs. Location Europe and contiguous USA. Methods We contrasted the climate conditions occupied by 51 plant species in their native (European) and naturalized (USA) distributions by applying kernel smoothers to species' occurrence densities. We asked whether species had naturalized in climate conditions that differ from their native ranges, suggesting climatic disequilibrium in the native range, and whether characteristics of species' native distributions correspond with climatic equilibrium. Results A large proportion of species' naturalized distributions occurred outside the climatic conditions occupied in their native ranges: for 22 species, the majority of their naturalized ranges fell outside their native climate conditions. Our analyses revealed large areas in Europe that species do not occupy, but which match climatic conditions occupied in the USA, suggesting a high degree of climatic disequilibrium in the native range. Disequilibrium was most severe for species with native ranges that are small and occupy a narrow range of climatic conditions. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that the direct effects of climate on species distributions have been widely overestimated, and that previous large-scale validations of the equilibrium assumption using species' native and naturalized distributions are not generally applicable. Non-climatic range limitations are likely to be the norm, rather than the exception, and pose added risks for species under climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Early","given":"Regan"},{"family":"Sax","given":"Dov F."}],"citation-key":"EarlySax_2014","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12208","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.12208","page":"1356-1365","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Climatic niche shifts between species' native and naturalized ranges raise concern for ecological forecasts during invasions and climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12208","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"EckertEtAl_2008","abstract":"There is growing interest in quantifying genetic population structure across the geographical ranges of species to understand why species might exhibit stable range limits and to assess the conservation value of peripheral populations. However, many assertions regarding peripheral populations rest on the long-standing but poorly tested supposition that peripheral populations exhibit low genetic diversity and greater genetic differentiation as a consequence of smaller effective population size and greater geographical isolation relative to geographically central populations. We reviewed 134 studies representing 115 species that tested for declines in within-population genetic diversity and/or increases in among-population differentiation towards range margins using nuclear molecular genetic markers. On average, 64.2% of studies detected the expected decline in diversity, 70.2% of those that tested for it showed increased differentiation and there was a positive association between these trends. In most cases, however, the difference in genetic diversity between central and peripheral population was not large. Although these results were consistent across plants and animals, strong taxonomic and biogeographical biases in the available studies call for a cautious generalization of these results. Despite the large number of studies testing these simple predictions, very few attempted to test possible mechanisms causing reduced peripheral diversity or increased differentiation. Almost no study incorporated a phylogeographical framework to evaluate historical influences on contemporary genetic patterns. Finally, there has been little effort to test whether these geographical trends in putatively neutral variation at marker loci are reflected by quantitative genetic trait variation, which is likely to influence the adaptive potential of populations across the geographical range.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Eckert","given":"C.

  {"id":"EhrichEtAl_2008","abstract":"Aim During the last ice age large parts of the north boreal and subarctic zones were covered by ice, while the climate in ice-free regions of northern Asia was extremely cold and dry. The extensive peatlands of these zones with their characteristic vegetation developed at the beginning of the Holocene. We combine a phylogeographical approach with maps of pollen records to identify regions where Rubus chamaemorus, a plant of moist, peaty soils, was likely to grow during this period. Location Circumarctic/circumboreal. Methods Samples were collected from 45 locations throughout much of the range of R. chamaemorus and 398 plants were analysed with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Estimates of diversity and differentiation, principal coordinates analysis and Bayesian clustering methods were used for the analysis of genetic data. Dated pollen records were retrieved from the European and the Global Pollen Databases. Results The plants from Sakhalin are highly divergent from the rest of the material and represent the previously described var. pseudochamaemorus. The main genetic division in R. chamaemorus sensu stricto is found in the Taymyr region in central Eurasia. Genetic diversity and the relative number of rare markers are highest in central Siberia and eastern Asia and decrease towards Europe and to a lesser extent eastwards through North America. Pollen dating back to the last ice age is found in central and eastern Siberia and Alaska. The maximum observed clone size is about 250 m, and more than one clone is found in nearly every local population. Main conclusions The genetic data are consistent with the pollen records and indicate that R. chamaemorus was growing in several areas of northern central Siberia and Beringia during the last glaciation. This finding suggests that sufficient humidity for this and other species of peaty soils was present locally in different parts of the generally dry ice-free areas of northern Asia, as had been previously documented for Beringia. The AFLP data show that var. pseudochamaemorus, which is also morphologically quite divergent, clearly represents a distinct genetic entity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ehrich","given":"Dorothee"},{"family":"Alsos","given":"Inger Greve"},{"family":"Brochmann","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"EhrichEtAl_2008","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01864.x","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01864.x","page":"801-814","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Where did the northern peatland species survive the dry glacials: cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) as an example","title-short":"Where did the northern peatland species survive the dry glacials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01864.x","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"ElithEtAl_2006","abstract":"Prediction of species’ distributions is central to diverse applications in ecology, evolution and conservation science. There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species’ distributions.

  {"id":"ElithEtAl_2010","abstract":"1. Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models’ assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species. 2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an example, predicting potential distributions under both current and climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of extrapolation. 3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment, particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data. Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario. 4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling software, MaxEnt. Our results also show that deliberately controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in non-equilibrium and novel settings. 5. Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate change. Predictions of future species distributions are required for management, but there are acknowledged problems with many current methods, and relatively few advances in techniques for understanding or overcoming these. The methods presented in this manuscript and made accessible in MaxEnt provide a forward step.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Elith","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Kearney","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"ElithEtAl_2010","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x","page":"330-342","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The art of modelling range-shifting species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"ElshireEtAl_2011","abstract":"Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Elshire","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Glaubitz","given":"Jeffrey C."},{"family":"Sun","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Poland","given":"Jesse A."},{"family":"Kawamoto","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Sharon E."}],"citation-key":"ElshireEtAl_2011","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0019379","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,5,4]]},"PMCID":"PMC3087801","PMID":"21573248","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A Robust, Simple Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) Approach for High Diversity Species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3087801/","volume":"6"},

In order to make an informed decision land managers need to be able to predict the spread of these invasive species at local scales and without the need for excessive sampling. Our approach uses a hybrid model, combining habitat suitability and the presence of the invasive in neighbouring cells to predict the probability of a cell being invaded over time. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to create a habitat suitability model and a spread model. The habitat suitability model predicts the presence of buckthorn based on environmental characteristics and the results are used in the spread model. The spread model indicates that the invasion of buckthorn is influenced by the suitability of habitat and the presence of buckthorn in neighbouring cells. The success of the spread model suggests that this approach can be used to create a spatiotemporally explicit model with limited sampling effort.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Endicott","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Drescher","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Brenning","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"EndicottEtAl_2017","container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-017-1504-3","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2993-3011","source":"Springer Link","title":"Modelling the spread of European buckthorn in the Region of Waterloo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1504-3","volume":"19"},

A recent Bayesian algorithm implemented in the software structure allows the identification of such groups.

The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual-based model. We found that in most cases the estimated ‘log probability of data’ does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic ΔK based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that structure accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested.

  {"id":"ExcoffierEtAl_1992","abstract":"We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Excoffier","given":"L."},{"family":"Smouse","given":"P.

Rather than modelling species within communities, we use these techniques to model large numbers of loci across genomes. Using balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can accommodate nonlinear responses of loci to environmental gradients. We identify a threshold response to temperature in the circadian clock gene GIGANTEA-5 (GI5), suggesting that this gene has experienced strong local adaptation to temperature. We also demonstrate how these methods can map ecological adaptation from genomic data, including the identification of predicted differences in the genetic composition of populations under current and future climates.

  {"id":"FordEtAl_1991","abstract":"Morphological studies of the short-beaked members of Carex sect. Vesicariae have indicated that three species can be recognized: C. saxatilis (incl. C. miliaris and C. physocarpa), C. membranacea, and C. rotundata. To assess genetic relationships among species and gene diversity within species, 44 populations from throughout North America were surveyed electrophoretically for 12 enzymes encoded by 17 putative loci. Populations of the same species exhibited high genetic identities, with average values exceeding 0.950. Interspecific genetic identities ranged from 0.636 (between C. saxatilis and C. rotundata) to 0.880 (C. membranacea and C. rotundata). Alleles for the isozymes AAT-1, AAT-2, 6-PGD, PGI-2, PGM-2, and SKDH were useful in distinguishing C. saxatilis from C. membranacea and C. rotundata. Carex membranacea and C. rotundata were best distinguished by alleles of 6-PGD. There was little allozyme differentiation within the C. saxatilis complex; however, a weak east/west cline was evident. Within populations, observed heterozygosity closely matched expected levels of heterozygosity: F values averaged 0.039, indicating outcrossing is prevalent.

  {"id":"FordEtAl_1998","abstract":"A taxonomic study by Naczi, Reznicek, and Ford (American Journal of Botany, 85, 434–447, 1998) has determined that three species (Carex willdenowii, C. basiantha, and C. superata) can be recognized within the C. willdenowii complex. To determine the amount of genetic divergence within and between these species, allozyme analyses were conducted on 14 populations distributed from Pennsylvania to eastern Texas. Seventeen loci were surveyed, 13 of which were polymorphic, with all populations being polymorphic at one or more loci. Interspecific genetic identities ranged from 0.560 (C. willdenowii and C. basiantha) to 0.807 (C. basiantha and C. superata). Alleles for the isozymes Aat-1, Dia-1, Idh-2, Mdh-2, Per-1, Pgm-1, and Pgm-2 served to distinguish C. willdenowii from C. basiantha and C. superata. Carex basiantha and C. superata were recognized by alleles of Mdh-2, Pgm-1, and Tpi-2. The genetic identities of populations within species were high and exceeded 0.957. A caespitose growth habit and perigynia in close proximity to the staminate flowers suggest adaptations for selfing and therefore low levels of heterozygosity. Paradoxically, the values for expected heterozygosities (Hexp) were always lower than those obtained by direct count (Hobs): F values were highly negative, indicating heterozygous excess. Disassortative mating and selection are discussed as possible mechanisms for maintaining heterozygous excess within populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ford","given":"Bruce A."},{"family":"McQueen","given":"D.

Because conservation biology has such a broad scope and relevance to the community at large, it is faced with several controversial issues such as the dichotomy between the preservation of individual species versus a broader focus on the ecosystem; the relative importance to give to endangered species; the design and management of reserves and the value of corridors; and the drive for increasing agricultural productivity through plant improvement versus the drive to maintain traditional peasant varieties in cultivation. Here, these and other issues are examined, by emphasizing and exploring the underlying scientific principles.

Genetic theory predicts that levels of genetic variation should increase with effective population size. Soulé (1976) compiled the first convincing evidence that levels of genetic variation in wildlife were related to population size, but this issue remains controversial. The hypothesis that genetic variation is related to population size leads to the following predictions: (1) genetic variation within species should be related to population size; (2) genetic variation within species should be related to island size; (3) genetic variation should be related to population size within taxonomic groups; (4) widespread species should have more genetic variation than restricted species; (5) genetic variation in animals should be negatively correlated with body size; (6) genetic variation should be negatively correlated with rate of chromosome evolution; (7) genetic variation across species should be related to population size; (8) vertebrates should have less genetic variation than invertebrates or plants; (9) island populations should have less genetic variation than mainland populations; and (10) endangered species should have less genetic variation than nonendangered species. Empirical observations support all these hypotheses. There can be no doubt that genetic variation is related to population size, as Soulé proposed.

  {"id":"Frankham_2015","abstract":"Many species have fragmented distribution with small isolated populations suffering inbreeding depression and/or reduced ability to evolve. Without gene flow from another population within the species (genetic rescue), these populations are likely to be extirpated. However, there have been only 20 published cases of such outcrossing for conservation purposes, probably a very low proportion of populations that would potentially benefit. As one impediment to genetic rescues is the lack of an overview of the magnitude and consistency of genetic rescue effects in wild species, I carried out a meta-analysis. Outcrossing of inbred populations resulted in beneficial effects in 92.9% of 156 cases screened as having a low risk of outbreeding depression. The median increase in composite fitness (combined fecundity and survival) following outcrossing was 148% in stressful environments and 45% in benign ones. Fitness benefits also increased significantly with maternal ΔF (reduction in inbreeding coefficient due to gene flow) and for naturally outbreeding versus inbreeding species. However, benefits did not differ significantly among invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. Evolutionary potential for fitness characters in inbred populations also benefited from gene flow. There are no scientific impediments to the widespread use of outcrossing to genetically rescue inbred populations of naturally outbreeding species, provided potential crosses have a low risk of outbreeding depression. I provide revised guidelines for the management of genetic rescue attempts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Frankham","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"Frankham_2015","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.13139","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.13139","page":"2610-2618","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Genetic rescue of small inbred populations: meta-analysis reveals large and consistent benefits of gene flow","title-short":"Genetic rescue of small inbred populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13139","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"FrankhamEtAl_2011","abstract":"Abstract: Fragmentation of animal and plant populations typically leads to genetic erosion and increased probability of extirpation. Although these effects can usually be reversed by re-establishing gene flow between population fragments, managers sometimes fail to do so due to fears of outbreeding depression (OD). Rapid development of OD is due primarily to adaptive differentiation from selection or fixation of chromosomal variants. Fixed chromosomal variants can be detected empirically. We used an extended form of the breeders’ equation to predict the probability of OD due to adaptive differentiation between recently isolated population fragments as a function of intensity of selection, genetic diversity, effective population sizes, and generations of isolation. Empirical data indicated that populations in similar environments had not developed OD even after thousands of generations of isolation. To predict the probability of OD, we developed a decision tree that was based on the four variables from the breeders’ equation, taxonomic status, and gene flow within the last 500 years. The predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations is elevated when the populations have at least one of the following characteristics: are distinct species, have fixed chromosomal differences, exchanged no genes in the last 500 years, or inhabit different environments. Conversely, the predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations of the same species is low for populations with the same karyotype, isolated for <500 years, and that occupy similar environments. In the former case, we recommend crossing be avoided or tried on a limited, experimental basis. In the latter case, crossing can be carried out with low probability of OD. We used crosses with known results to test the decision tree and found that it correctly identified cases where OD occurred. Current concerns about OD in recently fragmented populations are almost certainly excessive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Frankham","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ballou","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Eldridge","given":"Mark D.

  {"id":"FriedmanBarrett_2009","abstract":"• Monoecy and protogyny are widespread in wind-pollinated plants and have been interpreted as outcrossing mechanisms, though few studies have investigated their function. Carex, a large genus of anemophilous herbs, is predominantly monoecious and many species are protogynous. We investigated whether monoecy and protogyny limit self-pollination in seven Carex species. • We conducted field experiments comparing stigmatic pollen loads and seed set between intact and emasculated stems. We tested for self-compatibility and evaluated pollen limitation of seed set by supplemental pollination. Finally, we measured outcrossing rates in open-pollinated and emasculated stems using allozyme markers. • Emasculated stems captured significantly less pollen than open-pollinated stems and set less seed. Pollen deposition during the female-only phase for intact stems was only 12% of the total captured. Outcrossing rates for three species indicated high selfing (range t = 0.03–0.39). Allozyme loci in the remaining species were monomorphic also suggesting high selfing. These results demonstrate that neither monoecy nor protogyny is particularly effective at limiting self-fertilization. • Selection for the avoidance of selfing is unlikely to maintain monoecy in many Carex species although protogyny may provide limited opportunities for outcrossing. We propose that geitonogamy in self-compatible wind-pollinated species with unisexual flowers may be widespread and provides reproductive assurance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Friedman","given":"Jannice"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Spencer C.

  {"id":"GallagherEtAl_2010","abstract":"1. The potential invasive success of exotic plant species is thought to be associated with similarity in climate and biome between the original and novel range. We tested this assumption by quantifying the match between the realized climatic niches and biomes occupied in the exotic and native range of 26 plant species introduced to Australia. We then explored correlations between the propensity to shift climatic niche with residence time, invasion status, geographic range size, and species traits. 2. Occurrence data from the native and exotic range of 26 species introduced to Australia were obtained, and the overlap between native and exotic climate niches was calculated using between-class analysis. Shifts into novel biomes were assessed using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Correlations between introduction, distribution and species traits and the degree of climate matching were examined using nonparametric statistical tests. 3. Exotic species frequently occurred in climatic conditions outside those occupied in their native range (20 of 26 species). Nineteen species inhabited biomes in Australia not occupied in the native range and in some instances this shift represented the establishment of populations in novel biomes not present in the native range. No single-species trait, introduction or distributional characteristic was significantly associated with the degree of climatic niche shift. 4. Synthesis. Exotic species are able to occupy climate niches in the new range that differ substantially from those of the native range, and generally do not show biome conservatism between their native and introduced ranges. This implies that novel climatic conditions are not a major obstacle for exotic species establishing populations outside their native range. These results have important implications for the use and interpretation of ecological niche models used to predict the distribution of species in novel climates in time or space. The results also highlight the importance of alternate mechanisms, such as enemy release, phenotypic plasticity or rapid evolution, in the establishment of naturalized and invasive populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallagher","given":"Rachael V."},{"family":"Beaumont","given":"Linda J."},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Lesley"},{"family":"Leishman","given":"Michelle R."}],"citation-key":"GallagherEtAl_2010","container-title":"Journal of Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01677.x","ISSN":"1365-2745","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01677.x","page":"790-799","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evidence for climatic niche and biome shifts between native and novel ranges in plant species introduced to Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01677.x","volume":"98"},
  {"id":"GallienEtAl_2012","abstract":"Aim Two core assumptions of species distribution models (SDMs) do not hold when modelling invasive species. Invasives are not in equilibrium with their environment and niche quantification and transferability in space and time are limited. Here, we test whether combining global- and regional-scale data in a novel framework can overcome these limitations. Beyond simply improving regional niche modelling of non-native species, the framework also makes use of the violation of regional equilibrium assumptions, and aims at estimating the stage of invasion, range filling and risk of spread in the near future for 27 invasive species in the French Alps. Innovation For each invader we built three sets of SDMs using a committee averaging method: one global model and two regional models (a conventional model and one using the global model output to weight pseudo-absences). Model performances were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the true skill statistic, sensitivity and specificity scores. Then, we extracted the predictions for observed presences and compared them to global and regional models. This comparison made it possible to identify whether invasive species were observed within or outside of their regional and global niches. Main conclusions This study provides a novel methodological framework for improving the regional modelling of invasive species, where the use of a global model output to weight pseudo-absences in a regional model significantly improved the predictive performance of regional SDMs. Additionally, the comparison of the global and regional model outputs revealed distinct patterns of niche estimates and range filling among the species. These differences allowed us to draw conclusions about the stage of invasion and the risk of spread in the near future, which both correspond to experts' expectations. This framework can be easily applied to a large number of species and is therefore useful for control of biological invasions and eradication planning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallien","given":"Laure"},{"family":"Douzet","given":"Rolland"},{"family":"Pratte","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Niklaus E."},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"}],"citation-key":"GallienEtAl_2012","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2012.00768.x","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2012.00768.x","page":"1126-1136","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Invasive species distribution models – how violating the equilibrium assumption can create new insights","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2012.00768.x","volume":"21"},

Here, we describe an emerging modelling approach, ΔTraitSDM, which attempts to achieve this by explaining species distribution ranges based on phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation of fitness-related traits measured across large geographical gradients. The collection of intraspecific trait data measured in common gardens spanning broad environmental clines has promoted the development of these new models – first in trees but now rapidly expanding to other organisms. We review, explain and harmonize the main findings from this new generation of models that, by including trait variation over geographical scales, are able to provide new insights into future species ranges. Overall, ΔTraitSDM predictions generally deliver a less alarming message than previous models of species distribution under new climates, indicating that phenotypic plasticity should help, to a considerable degree, some plant populations to persist under climate change. The development of ΔTraitSDMs offers a new perspective to analyse intraspecific variation in single and multiple traits, with the rationale that trait (co)variation and consequently fitness can significantly change across geographical gradients and new climates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Garzón","given":"Marta Benito"},{"family":"Robson","given":"T.

Internal feeders and sap suckers were prioritized for biological control from over 30 specialized insects identified from the target plant in its native European range. Five leaf-feeding moths were also considered for further investigations. Field observations and preliminary host range tests with the stem-boring beetle Oberea pedemontana, the root-boring moth Synanthedon stomoxiformis, the shoot-tip-boring moth Sorhagenia janiszewskae and the leaf-feeding moths Ancylis apicella, A. unculana, Triphosa dubitata, Philereme transversata and P. vetulata confirmed that all of these species were lacking host specificity in no-choice conditions. Choice oviposition tests carried out with most of the prioritized species to assess their ecological host range yielded unreliable results. Three psyllids, Trichochermes walkeri, Cacopsylla rhamnicolla and Trioza rhamni are promising in terms of host specificity, but are infected with the plant disease ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma rhamni’. Fruit- or seed-feeding insects may present the best potential for biological control of buckthorn in directly reducing seed set and thus seedling establishment. However, it was not possible to obtain adult fruiting trees of native North American Rhamnus species for testing. It is concluded that there are no promising arthropod agents based on what is known to date. Pathogens could offer new opportunities for biological control of R. cathartica in North America.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Gassmann","given":"A."},{"family":"Tosevski","given":"I."}],"citation-key":"GassmannTosevski_2014","container-title":"Journal of Applied Entomology","DOI":"10.1111/jen.12104","ISSN":"1439-0418","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jen.12104","page":"1-13","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Biological control of Rhamnus cathartica: is it feasible?

Experiments were conducted over three generations and under four environments of temperature and water availability resembling typical and climate change conditions in each ecosystem. Amax increased across generations for most species. Invasive species from Arid, Alpine, and Antarctic ecosystems showed similar, greater, and lesser evolution of Amax than their native counterparts, respectively. The Mediterranean invasive species showed greater evolution of Amax than its naturalized congener. Similar patterns were observed in all four experimental environments for each ecosystem, suggesting that comparable responses may be expected under climate change scenarios. All study species showed a positive association between Amax and reproductive output.

Distinguishing the contribution of ecological, historical, and stochastic processes to the origin and maintenance of biogeographic boundaries, however, is a longstanding challenge. Taking advantage of newly available data and methods—including environmental niche models and associated comparative metrics—we develop a framework to test two possible ecological explanations for biogeographic boundaries: (1) sharp environmental gradients and (2) ribbons of unsuitable habitat dividing two highly suitable regions. We test each of these hypotheses against the null expectation that environmental variation across a given boundary is no greater than expected by chance. We apply this framework to a pair of Hispaniolan Anolis lizards (A. chlorocyanus and A. coelestinus) distributed on the either side of this island's most important biogeographic boundary. Integrating our results with historical biogeographic analysis, we find that a ribbon of particularly unsuitable habitat is acting to maintain a boundary between species that initially diverged on distinct paleo-islands, which merged to form present-day Hispaniola in the Miocene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Glor","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Warren","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"GlorWarren_2011","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01177.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01177.x","page":"673-683","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Testing Ecological Explanations for Biogeographic Boundaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01177.x","volume":"65"},
  {"id":"GodtEtAl_1996","abstract":"Allozyme diversity was examined in four rare, high-montane plant species from the Appalachian Mountains of southeastern North America. These species may represent relictual members or descendants of an alpine community that was more widespread during the late Pleistocene. We sampled five populations of Geum radiatum (Rosaceae), Carex misera (Cyperaceae), Trichophorum cespitosum (Cyperaceae), and the four known populations of Calamagrostis cainii (Poaceae). Genetic diversity was low for all species but was typical of that found for plant species with limited ranges. Low genetic diversity may reflect historical events associated with changes in the species’ biogeography. As the Pleistocene climate warmed, suitable habitat decreased in areal extent and became fragmented, probably resulting in smaller, more-isolated populations. In recent times these species, which co-occur in fragile rock outcrop habitats, have been adversely affected by human activities. Genetic analyses revealed reduced diversity in populations of decreasing size for three species. Estimates of gene flow were low (Nm < 1.0) in all four species. Positive associations between genetic diversity and population size, evidence of recent population declines, and the low estimates of gene flow suggest that genetic drift may play a prominent role in shaping the present-day genetic composition of these species. Furthermore, these data suggest that the genetically depauperate populations are unlikely to regain genetic variation without human intervention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Godt","given":"Mary Jo W."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Bart R."},{"family":"Hamrick","given":"J.

  {"id":"GruntmanEtAl_2017","abstract":"The success of invasive plants has often been attributed to their rapid evolution at the introduced range. In particular, release from native enemies has been suggested to select for an evolutionary shift in resource allocation patterns from herbivore defence to increased size. Such evolutionary processes can take place not only between the native and invasive ranges but also within the invasive range over time, but this premise has been very seldom studied. In this study, we examined the potential for post-invasion evolution in two traits hypothesized to facilitate plant invasion success, that is herbivore resistance and allelopathic ability. We studied these traits in the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera by comparing plants from its native populations and from populations across its invasion chronosequence. Results of common-garden experiment and chemical analyses revealed that plants from native populations or older populations within the invasive range show greater resistance to the generalist herbivore, Deilephila elpenor, coupled with greater production of the secondary defence compound 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone glycoside. In contrast, no differences were found between populations in their allelopathic effect on the germination of the co-occurring neighbour, Urtica doica. Finally, results from a field survey suggested that older populations within the invasive range incur greater attack rates from local herbivores compared to more recently established populations. Synthesis. Our findings support the idea that the selection pressure of enemy release at the introduced range might attenuate over time, leading to the evolutionary recovery of enemy resistance.

For molecular studies, progress has been limited by low levels of sequence divergence, leading to insufficient topological resolution and statistical support in phylogenetic trees, particularly for the major lineages and for the numerous species occurring in Madagascar. We report here the first almost fully resolved, broadly sampled phylogenetic hypothesis for coffee, the result of combining genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technology with a newly developed, lab-based workflow to integrate short read next-generation sequencing for low numbers of additional samples. Biogeographic patterns indicate either Africa or Asia (or possibly the Arabian Peninsula) as the most likely ancestral locality for the origin of the coffee genus, with independent radiations across Africa, Asia, and the Western Indian Ocean Islands (including Madagascar and Mauritius). The evolution of caffeine, an important trait for commerce and society, was evaluated in light of our phylogeny. High and consistent caffeine content is found only in species from the equatorial, fully humid environments of West and Central Africa, possibly as an adaptive response to increased levels of pest predation. Moderate caffeine production, however, evolved at least one additional time recently (between 2 and 4Mya) in a Madagascan lineage, which suggests that either the biosynthetic pathway was already in place during the early evolutionary history of coffee, or that caffeine synthesis within the genus is subject to convergent evolution, as is also the case for caffeine synthesis in coffee versus tea and chocolate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamon","given":"Perla"},{"family":"Grover","given":"Corrinne E."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Aaron P."},{"family":"Rakotomalala","given":"Jean-Jacques"},{"family":"Raharimalala","given":"Nathalie E."},{"family":"Albert","given":"Victor A."},{"family":"Sreenath","given":"Hosahalli L."},{"family":"Stoffelen","given":"Piet"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Sharon E."},{"family":"Couturon","given":"Emmanuel"},{"family":"Hamon","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Kochko","given":"Alexandre","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Crouzillat","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Rigoreau","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Sumirat","given":"Ucu"},{"family":"Akaffou","given":"Sélastique"},{"family":"Guyot","given":"Romain"}],"citation-key":"HamonEtAl_2017","container-title":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.ympev.2017.02.009","ISSN":"1055-7903","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"351-361","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Genotyping-by-sequencing provides the first well-resolved phylogeny for coffee (Coffea) and insights into the evolution of caffeine content in its species: GBS coffee phylogeny and the evolution of caffeine content","title-short":"Genotyping-by-sequencing provides the first well-resolved phylogeny for coffee (Coffea) and insights into the evolution of caffeine content in its species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790317301288","volume":"109"},

Fruit detection results indicate that the semisupervised method, based on Gaussian Mixture Models, outperforms the deep learning-based methods in the majority of the data sets. For fruit counting though, the deep learning-based approach performs better for all of the data sets. Combining these two methods, we achieve yield estimation accuracies ranging from 95.56% to 97.83%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Häni","given":"Nicolai"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Pravakar"},{"family":"Isler","given":"Volkan"}],"citation-key":"HaniEtAl_2020","container-title":"Journal of Field Robotics","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.21902","ISSN":"1556-4967","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"263-282","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A comparative study of fruit detection and counting methods for yield mapping in apple orchards","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rob.21902","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"HarrisEtAl_2014","abstract":"Climate projections are essential for studying ecological responses to climate change, and their use is now common in ecology. However, the lack of integration between ecology and climate science has restricted understanding of the available climate data and their appropriate use. We provide an overview of climate model outputs and issues that need to be considered when applying projections of future climate in ecological studies. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of available climate projections, the uncertainty associated with future projections at different spatial and temporal scales, the differences between available downscaling methods (dynamical, statistical downscaling, and simple scaling of global circulation model output), and the implications these have for ecological models. We describe some of the changes in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including the new representative concentration pathways. We highlight some of the challenges in using model projections in ecological studies and suggest how to effectively address them.

  {"id":"HauberEtAl_2011","abstract":"Multiple introductions are believed to play an important role in increasing genetic diversity and adaptability of invasive species, but there are few well-documented examples. The common reed, Phragmites australis, has dramatically increased in tidal wetlands throughout the USA in the past century due primarily to the introduction of a Eurasian lineage. In the Mississippi River “Balize” delta, P. australis is the dominant vegetation where monotypic stands of an introduced form blanket the outer marshes. The delta’s interior marshes, on the other hand, are more vegetatively diverse, serving as important waterfowl foraging habitat. Recent encroachment by various phenotypic forms of P. australis into the interior marshes led to this study examining genetic variation in these stands. Our results revealed four chloroplast DNA haplotypes that also segregate based on microsatellite variation. Three of these are closely related and introduced, but differ relative to time and likely mode of introduction. The “Delta” type (haplotype M1), which is unique to the region and the most common lineage, displays considerable microsatellite diversity. The Eurasian introduced lineage of P. australis (haplotype M), which is invasive elsewhere in North America, is increasing its distribution in the delta. A novel haplotype, AD, was also identified which is phenotypically and genetically similar to haplotype M. Despite the close relatedness, we found no evidence for inter-haplotype gene exchange at the nuclear level, suggesting that intraspecific hybridization is not a contributing factor to these invasions. The site provides a unique opportunity for researchers to understand the dynamics of multiple P. australis invasions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hauber","given":"Donald P."},{"family":"Saltonstall","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"White","given":"David A."},{"family":"Hood","given":"Craig S."}],"citation-key":"HauberEtAl_2011","container-title":"Estuaries and Coasts","container-title-short":"Estuaries and Coasts","DOI":"10.1007/s12237-011-9391-9","ISSN":"1559-2731","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"851-862","source":"Springer Link","title":"Genetic Variation in the Common Reed, Phragmites australis, in the Mississippi River Delta Marshes: Evidence for Multiple Introductions","title-short":"Genetic Variation in the Common Reed, Phragmites australis, in the Mississippi River Delta Marshes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-011-9391-9","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"HeimpelEtAl_2010","abstract":"We consider the possibility of an extensive invasional meltdown occurring in central North America involving eleven Eurasian species. The scenario begins with the potential co-facilitation between the European earthworm Lumbricus terrestris and European buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica. Once introduced, European buckthorn has served as the overwintering host for two important invasive crop pests, oat crown rust, Puccinea coronata and the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines. The spread of R. cathartica itself may have been aided by seed dispersal by the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, and the presence of L. terrestris has likely facilitated the invasion of Bipalium adventitium, an Asian predatory flatworm that specializes on earthworms. Beyond this, the soybean aphid is consumed by a number of introduced species, including the lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, the ground beetle Agonum muelleri and the parasitoid Aphelinus certus. We hypothesize that the presence of soybean aphid increases regional abundances of these species. We discuss both the evidence for this multi-species invasional meltdown scenario and potential implications of meltdown dynamics for invasive species management. The particular management issues that we discuss are: (1) opportunities for managing multiple invasive species simultaneously by targeting facilitator species, and (2) implications of meltdown dynamics for biological control introductions against the soybean aphid.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Heimpel","given":"George E."},{"family":"Frelich","given":"Lee E."},{"family":"Landis","given":"Douglas A."},{"family":"Hopper","given":"Keith R."},{"family":"Hoelmer","given":"Kim A."},{"family":"Sezen","given":"Zeynep"},{"family":"Asplen","given":"Mark K."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Kongming"}],"citation-key":"HeimpelEtAl_2010","container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-010-9736-5","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2913-2931","source":"Springer Link","title":"European buckthorn and Asian soybean aphid as components of an extensive invasional meltdown in North America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-010-9736-5","volume":"12"},

Coastal, high-latitude regions are particularly impacted by global climate change because their location at the land-sea ecotone subjects them to both terrestrial stressors and shifting ocean dynamics. Although changes in near-shore vegetation communities have been previously documented for the sub-Arctic coastal region of Alaska, we know little about vegetation dynamics in the permafrost-underlain portions of the landscape that support berry communities. To fill this gap, surveys were administered in four communities within the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta to identify observations of changes in berry resources and integrate Indigenous Knowledge of drivers of changes with climate projections. We found that while many participants identified changes in berry phenology, abundance, and habitat related to climate drivers, important differences in responses were identified at the community level. Regional consensus can be used in combination with climate projections to forecast potential future impacts to berry resources, while distinctions at the community level can help to account for impacts of local scale disturbances and importance of social context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Herman-Mercer","given":"Nicole M."},{"family":"Loehman","given":"Rachel A."},{"family":"Toohey","given":"Ryan C."},{"family":"Paniyak","given":"Cynthia"}],"citation-key":"Herman-MercerEtAl_2020","container-title":"Human Ecology","container-title-short":"Hum Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/s10745-020-00138-4","ISSN":"1572-9915","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"85-99","source":"Springer Link","title":"Climate- and Disturbance-Driven Changes in Subsistence Berries in Coastal Alaska: Indigenous Knowledge to Inform Ecological Inference","title-short":"Climate- and Disturbance-Driven Changes in Subsistence Berries in Coastal Alaska","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-020-00138-4","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"Hicksetal._2016","abstract":"Planted meadows are increasingly used to improve the biodiversity and aesthetic amenity value of urban areas. Although many ‘pollinator-friendly’ seed mixes are available, the floral resources these provide to flower-visiting insects, and how these change through time, are largely unknown. Such data are necessary to compare the resources provided by alternative meadow seed mixes to each other and to other flowering habitats. We used quantitative surveys of over 2 million flowers to estimate the nectar and pollen resources offered by two exemplar commercial seed mixes (one annual, one perennial) and associated weeds grown as 300m2 meadows across four UK cities, sampled at six time points between May and September 2013. Nectar sugar and pollen rewards per flower varied widely across 65 species surveyed, with native British weed species (including dandelion, Taraxacum agg.) contributing the top five nectar producers and two of the top ten pollen producers. Seed mix species yielding the highest rewards per flower included Leontodon hispidus, Centaurea cyanus and C. nigra for nectar, and Papaver rhoeas, Eschscholzia californica and Malva moschata for pollen. Perennial meadows produced up to 20x more nectar and up to 6x more pollen than annual meadows, which in turn produced far more than amenity grassland controls. Perennial meadows produced resources earlier in the year than annual meadows, but both seed mixes delivered very low resource levels early in the year and these were provided almost entirely by native weeds. Pollen volume per flower is well predicted statistically by floral morphology, and nectar sugar mass and pollen volume per unit area are correlated with flower counts, raising the possibility that resource levels can be estimated for species or habitats where they cannot be measured directly. Our approach does not incorporate resource quality information (for example, pollen protein or essential amino acid content), but can easily do so when suitable data exist. Our approach should inform the design of new seed mixes to ensure continuity in floral resource availability throughout the year, and to identify suitable species to fill resource gaps in established mixes.","author":[{"family":"Hicks","given":"Damien M."},{"family":"et al.","given":""}],"citation-key":"Hicksetal._2016","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0158117","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,24]]},"title":"Food for Pollinators: Quantifying the Nectar and Pollen Resources of Urban Flower Meadows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158117","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"HirzelEtAl_2006","abstract":"Models predicting species spatial distribution are increasingly applied to wildlife management issues, emphasising the need for reliable methods to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions. As many available datasets (e.g. museums, herbariums, atlas) do not provide reliable information about species absences, several presence-only based analyses have been developed. However, methods to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions are few and have never been validated. The aim of this paper is to compare existing and new presence-only evaluators to usual presence/absence measures. We use a reliable, diverse, presence/absence dataset of 114 plant species to test how common presence/absence indices (Kappa, MaxKappa, AUC, adjusted D2) compare to presence-only measures (AVI, CVI, Boyce index) for evaluating generalised linear models (GLM). Moreover we propose a new, threshold-independent evaluator, which we call “continuous Boyce index”. All indices were implemented in the BIOMAPPER software. We show that the presence-only evaluators are fairly correlated (ρ>0.7) to the presence/absence ones. The Boyce indices are closer to AUC than to MaxKappa and are fairly insensitive to species prevalence. In addition, the Boyce indices provide predicted-to-expected ratio curves that offer further insights into the model quality: robustness, habitat suitability resolution and deviation from randomness. This information helps reclassifying predicted maps into meaningful habitat suitability classes. The continuous Boyce index is thus both a complement to usual evaluation of presence/absence models and a reliable measure of presence-only based predictions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirzel","given":"Alexandre H."},{"family":"Le Lay","given":"Gwenaëlle"},{"family":"Helfer","given":"Véronique"},{"family":"Randin","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"}],"citation-key":"HirzelEtAl_2006","collection-title":"Predicting Species Distributions","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.05.017","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,11,16]]},"language":"en","page":"142-152","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Evaluating the ability of habitat suitability models to predict species presences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006002468","volume":"199"},

  {"id":"HoldereggerEtAl_2006","abstract":"Genetic diversity is important for the maintenance of the viability and the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations and species. However, there are two principal types of genetic diversity: adaptive and neutral – a fact widely neglected by non-specialists. We introduce these two types of genetic diversity and critically point to their potential uses and misuses in population or landscape genetic studies. First, most molecular-genetic laboratory techniques analyse neutral genetic variation. This means that the gene variants detected do not have any direct effect on fitness. This type of genetic variation is thus selectively neutral and tells us nothing about the adaptive or evolutionary potential of a population or a species. Nevertheless, neutral genetic markers have great potential for investigating processes such as gene flow, migration or dispersal. Hence, they allow us to empirically test the functional relevance of spatial indices such as connectivity used in landscape ecology. Second, adaptive genetic variation, i.e. genetic variation under natural selection, is analysed in quantitative genetic experiments under controlled and uniform environmental conditions. Unfortunately, the genetic variation (i.e. heritability) and population differentiation at quantitative, adaptive traits is not directly linked with neutral genetic diversity or differentiation. Thus, neutral genetic data cannot serve as a surrogate of adaptive genetic data. In summary, neutral genetic diversity is well suited for the study of processes within landscapes such as gene flow, while the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations or species has to be assessed in quantitative genetic experiments. Landscape ecologists have to mind these differences between neutral and adaptive genetic variation when interpreting the results of landscape genetic studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Holderegger","given":"Rolf"},{"family":"Kamm","given":"Urs"},{"family":"Gugerli","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"HoldereggerEtAl_2006","container-title":"Landscape Ecology","container-title-short":"Landscape Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/s10980-005-5245-9","ISSN":"1572-9761","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"797-807","source":"Springer Link","title":"Adaptive vs. neutral genetic diversity: implications for landscape genetics","title-short":"Adaptive vs. neutral genetic diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-005-5245-9","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"HoltsfordEllstrand_1990","abstract":"Inbreeding depression is commonly observed in natural populations. The deleterious effects of forced inbreeding are often thought to be less pronounced in populations with self-pollinating mating systems than in primarily outcrossing populations. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the performance of plants produced by artificial self- and cross-pollination from three populations whose outcrossing rate estimates were 0.03, 0.26, and 0.58. Outcrossing rates and inbreeding coefficients were estimated using isozyme polymorphisms as genetic markers. Analysis of F statistics suggests that biparental inbreeding as well as self-fertilization contribute to the level of homozygosity in the seed crop. Biparental inbreeding will reduce the heterozygosity of progeny produced by outcrossing, relative to random outcrossing expectations, and hence will reduce the effects of outcrossing versus self-fertilization. Heterotic selection may increase the average heterozygosity during the life history. Selfed and outcrossed seeds from all three populations were equally likely to germinate and survive to reproduce. However, inbreeding depression was observed in fecundity traits of plants surviving to reproduction in all three populations. Even in the population whose natural self-fertilization rate was 97%, plants grown from seed produced by self-pollination produced fewer fruits and less total seed weight than plants grown from outcrossed seed. There was no detectable inbreeding depression in estimated lifetime fitness. Inbreeding effects for all reproductive yield characters were most severe in the accession from the most outcrossing population and least severe in the accession from the most self-fertilizing population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Holtsford","given":"Timothy P."},{"family":"Ellstrand","given":"Norman C."}],"citation-key":"HoltsfordEllstrand_1990","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.1990.tb04309.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1990.tb04309.x","page":"2031-2046","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Inbreeding effects in <i>Clarkia tembloriensis</i> (Onagraceae) populations with different natural outcrossing rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1990.tb04309.x","volume":"44"},

The translocation of organisms during the restoration of native ecosystems has provoked new questions concerning the consequences of sampling protocols and of intraspecific hybridization between locally adapted and transplanted genotypes. Studies are now underway to determine both the extent of local adaptation among focal populations and the potential risks of introducing foreign genotypes, including founder effects, genetic swamping and outbreeding depression. Data are needed to delineate ‘seed transfer zones’, or regions within which plants can be moved with little or no consequences for population fitness. Here, we address the revival of transplant and common garden studies, the use of novel molecular markers to predict population genetic consequences of translocation, and their combined power for determining appropriate seed transfer zones in restoration planning for native plant populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hufford","given":"Kristina M."},{"family":"Mazer","given":"Susan J."}],"citation-key":"HuffordMazer_2003","container-title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00002-8","ISSN":"0169-5347","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"147-155","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Plant ecotypes: genetic differentiation in the age of ecological restoration","title-short":"Plant ecotypes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703000028","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"HuppEtAl_2015","abstract":"BackgroundWild berries are a valued traditional food in Alaska. Phytochemicals in wild berries may contribute to the prevention of vascular disease, cancer and cognitive decline, making berry consumption important to community health in rural areas. Little was known regarding which species of berries were important to Alaskan communities, the number of species typically picked in communities and whether recent environmental change has affected berry abundance or quality.ObjectiveTo identify species of wild berries that were consumed by people in different ecological regions of Alaska and to determine if perceived berry abundance was changing for some species or in some regions.DesignWe asked tribal environmental managers throughout Alaska for their views on which among 12 types of wild berries were important to their communities and whether berry harvests over the past decade were different than in previous years. We received responses from 96 individuals in 73 communities.ResultsBerries that were considered very important to communities differed among ecological regions of Alaska. Low-bush blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum and V. caespitosum), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) and salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) were most frequently identified as very important berries for communities in the boreal, polar and maritime ecoregions, respectively. For 7 of the 12 berries on the survey, a majority of respondents indicated that in the past decade abundance had either declined or become more variable.ConclusionsOur study is an example of how environmental managers and participants in local observer networks can report on the status of wild resources in rural Alaska. Their observations suggest that there have been changes in the productivity of some wild berries in the past decade, resulting in greater uncertainty among communities regarding the security of berry harvests. Monitoring and experimental studies are needed to determine how environmental change may affect berry abundance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hupp","given":"Jerry"},{"family":"Brubaker","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"Kira"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"HuppEtAl_2015","container-title":"International Journal of Circumpolar Health","DOI":"10.3402/ijch.v74.28704","ISSN":"null","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,31]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.3402/ijch.v74.28704","page":"28704","PMID":"28417779","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"How are your berries?

  {"id":"JarvisEtAl_2008a","abstract":"Crop wild relatives are an important source of genetic diversity for crop improvement. However, the survival of some of these wild plant species could be threatened because of climate change. We used current and projected future climate data for ∼2055, and a climate envelope species distribution model to predict the impact of climate change on the wild relatives of peanut (Arachis), potato (Solanum) and cowpea (Vigna). We considered three migrational scenarios for modeling the range shifts (unlimited, limited, and no migration). Climate change strongly affected all taxa, with an estimated 16–22% (depending on migration scenario) of these species predicted to go extinct and most species losing over 50% of their range size. Moreover, for many species, the suitable areas become highly fragmented. Arachis were the most affected group, with 24–31 (depending on the migration scenario) of 51 species projected to go extinct and their distribution area on average reduced by 85–94%, depending on the migration scenario, over the next 50 years. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 19% under the no migration scenario or increase by 4% assuming unlimited migration. Patch size decreased by 55–60%. For Solanum, 7 (no migration) to 13 (unlimited migration) of 108 species were predicted to go extinct, and their range sizes were reduced by approximately 38–69%. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 34% (no migration) or increase 7% (unlimited migration) and patch size decreased by 20 (unlimited migration) to 37% (no migration). In terms of species extinction, Vigna was the least affected of the three groups, losing no species (unlimited migration) to 2 species (no migration) of the 48 species in the genus. The mean range size was predicted to decrease by 65% (no migration) or increase 8% (unlimited migration), with 8–41 of the 48 species losing more than 50% of their current geographic range. The number of Vigna patches increased by 12–115%, but the size of those patches shrunk by 51–59%. Our results suggest that there is an urgent need to identify and effectively conserve crop wild relatives that are at risk from climate change. While increased habitat conservation will be important to conserve most species, those that are predicted to undergo strong range size reductions should be a priority for collection and inclusion in genebanks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Jarvis","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Lane","given":"Annie"},{"family":"Hijmans","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"JarvisEtAl_2008a","collection-title":"International Agricultural Research and Climate Change: A Focus on Tropical Systems","container-title":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","container-title-short":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.agee.2008.01.013","ISSN":"0167-8809","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"13-23","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The effect of climate change on crop wild relatives","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880908000133","volume":"126"},

To gain a better understanding of the causes of the high fruit abortion frequency in cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus L.), we manipulated different sources of carbon, that is, leaves and rhizome. We also manipulated flower number to see if competition between floral ramets explained fruit abortion in cloudberry. Reducing the number of flowers had no impact on fruit abortion frequency. In fact, the species forms an extensive rhizome network with only a few ramets per clone and competition between floral ramets is unlikely. Ramet defoliation had limited impact on fruit abortion, but successful fruit development was affected by rhizome length. The longer the rhizome, the higher the chances to mature a fruit. These results suggest that current photoassimilate production by the reproductive ramet alone is insufficient to insure fruit development. Carbon can come from other ramets but distances are usually high between ramets. Fruit production might thus depend on the use of stored carbohydrates in the rhizome to balance insufficient photosynthetic contribution during fruit production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Jean","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Lapointe","given":"Line"}],"citation-key":"JeanLapointe_2001","container-title":"Physiologia Plantarum","DOI":"10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120311.x","ISSN":"1399-3054","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120311.x","page":"379-387","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Limited carbohydrate availability as a potential cause of fruit abortion in Rubus chamaemorus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120311.x","volume":"112"},

  {"id":"JombartEtAl_2008","abstract":"Increasing attention is being devoted to taking landscape information into account in genetic studies. Among landscape variables, space is often considered as one of the most important. To reveal spatial patterns, a statistical method should be spatially explicit, that is, it should directly take spatial information into account as a component of the adjusted model or of the optimized criterion. In this paper we propose a new spatially explicit multivariate method, spatial principal component analysis (sPCA), to investigate the spatial pattern of genetic variability using allelic frequency data of individuals or populations. This analysis does not require data to meet Hardy–Weinberg expectations or linkage equilibrium to exist between loci. The sPCA yields scores summarizing both the genetic variability and the spatial structure among individuals (or populations). Global structures (patches, clines and intermediates) are disentangled from local ones (strong genetic differences between neighbors) and from random noise. Two statistical tests are proposed to detect the existence of both types of patterns. As an illustration, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) and sPCA are compared using simulated datasets and real georeferenced microsatellite data of Scandinavian brown bear individuals (Ursus arctos). sPCA performed better than PCA to reveal spatial genetic patterns.

  {"id":"KellEtAl_2015","abstract":"The potentially devastating impacts of climate change on crop production and food security are now widely acknowledged. An important component of efforts to mitigate these impacts is the production of new varieties of crops which will be able to thrive in more extreme and changeable environmental conditions. There is therefore an urgent need to find new sources of genetic diversity for crop improvement. Wild plant species closely related to crops (crop wild relatives) contain vital sources of such genes, yet these resources themselves are threatened by the effects of climate change, as well as by a range of other human-induced pressures and socio-economic changes. The flora of China comprises more than 20,000 native higher plant species, a proportion of which have known or potential value as gene donors for crop improvement. However, until now, the full range of these valuable crop wild relative species had not been identified. In this paper we present a methodology for creating a checklist of, and prioritizing China’s crop wild relatives, and reveal that 871 native species are related to crops that are of particularly high socio-economic importance in China—including rice, wheat, soybean, potato, sweet potato, millet and yam—crops which are also of notably high value for food and economic security in other parts of the world. Within this list we have identified species that are in particular need of conservation assessment based on their relative Red List status and potential for use in crop improvement programs. Endemic species that have particularly high economic value potential in China and that are under severe threat of genetic erosion and thus in need of urgent conservation action include wild relatives of tea (Camellia fangchengensis S. Yun Liang et Y.C. Zhong and C. grandibracteata H.T. Chang et F.L.

  {"id":"KhazaeiEtAl_2013","abstract":"Efficient methods to explore plant agro-biodiversity for climate change adaptive traits are urgently required. The focused identification of germplasm strategy (FIGS) is one such approach. FIGS works on the premise that germplasm is likely to reflect the selection pressures of the environment in which it developed. Environmental parameters describing plant germplasm collection sites are used as selection criteria to improve the probability of uncovering useful variation. This study was designed to test the effectiveness of FIGS to search a large faba bean (Vicia faba L.) collection for traits related to drought adaptation. Two sets of faba bean accessions were created, one from moisture-limited environments, and the other from wetter sites. The two sets were grown under well watered conditions and leaf morpho-physiological traits related to plant water use were measured. Machine-learning algorithms split the accessions into two groups based on the evaluation data and the groups created by this process were compared to the original climate-based FIGS sets. The sets defined by trait data were in almost perfect agreement to the FIGS sets, demonstrating that ecotypic differentiation driven by moisture availability has occurred within the faba bean genepool. Leaflet and canopy temperature as well as relative water content contributed more than other traits to the discrimination between sets, indicating that their utility as drought-tolerance selection criteria for faba bean germplasm. This study supports the assertion that FIGS could be an effective tool to enhance the discovery of new genes for abiotic stress adaptation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Khazaei","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Street","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Bari","given":"Abdallah"},{"family":"Mackay","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Stoddard","given":"Frederick L."}],"citation-key":"KhazaeiEtAl_2013","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0063107","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,8]]},"language":"en","page":"e63107","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The FIGS (Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy) Approach Identifies Traits Related to Drought Adaptation in Vicia faba Genetic Resources","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063107","volume":"8"},

The United States contains a diverse native flora of CWR, including those of important cereal, fruit, nut, oil, pulse, root and tuber, and vegetable crops, which may be threatened in their natural habitats and underrepresented in plant conservation repositories. To determine conservation priorities for these plants, we developed a national inventory, compiled occurrence information, modeled potential distributions, and conducted threat assessments and conservation gap analyses for 600 native taxa.

  {"id":"KirkEtAl_2011","abstract":"• Premise of the study: The Eurasian subspecies of the common reed (Phragmites australis subsp. australis, hereafter abbreviated as P. a. australis) was introduced to North America in the late 18th century and rapidly expanded its range, posing an ecological threat to wetlands. In this study, we aimed to determine whether admixture among multiple lineages, dispersal mechanisms, and high genetic diversity have contributed to the invasion of P. a. australis in the northeastern part of its range. Understanding mechanisms of the P. a. australis invasion will 1) contribute to a broader understanding of the factors that facilitate plant invasion, and 2) help us to develop effective management strategies for wetlands threatened by P. a. australis invasion. • Methods: We used a population genetics approach incorporating nine microsatellite loci to study genetic diversity and population structure in relation to biogeography of introduced North American Phragmites a. australis stands in the northeastern continental region. • Key Results: Phragmites a. australis is genetically diverse in the region studied here. Significant population structure exists, and population structure is likely influenced by both long-distance dispersal via major waterways, and short-distance dispersal overland. Different lineages sometimes colonize geographically proximate locations leading to opportunities for admixture. Clonal reproduction likely exaggerates geographical structure among some stands, although high genetic and clonal diversity within some stands implies that sexual reproduction occurs frequently in P. a. australis. • Conclusions: A variety of factors, including admixture among multiple lineages, multiple modes of dispersal, and plasticity in reproductive strategy promote the invasion success of Phragmites a. australis. Wetland managers in the St. Lawrence River/Great Lakes region should focus monitoring efforts on the shores of conservation lands to prevent the establishment of propagules from novel lineages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirk","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Straka","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Freeland","given":"Joanna R."}],"citation-key":"KirkEtAl_2011","container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.3732/ajb.1000278","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.1000278","page":"1180-1190","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Long-distance dispersal and high genetic diversity are implicated in the invasive spread of the common reed, Phragmites australis (Poaceae), in northeastern North America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.1000278","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"KirkpatrickBarton_1997","abstract":"Gene flow from the center of a species' range can stymie adaptation at the periphery and prevent the range from expanding outward. We study this process using simple models that track both demography and the evolution of a quantitative trait in a population that is continuously distributed in space. Stabilizing selection acts on the trait and favors an optimum phenotype that changes linearly across the habitat. One of three outcomes is possible: the species will become extinct, expand to fill all of the available habitat, or be confined to a limited range in which it is sufficiently adapted to allow population growth. When the environment changes rapidly in space, increased migration inhibits local adaptation and so decreases the species' total population size. Gene flow can cause enough maladaptation that the peripheral half of a species' range acts as a demographic sink. The trait's genetic variance has little effect on species persistence or the size of the range when gene flow is sufficiently strong to keep population densities far below the carrying capacity throughout the range, but it can increase the range width and population size of an abundant species. Under some conditions, a small parameter change can dramatically shift the balance between gene flow and local adaptation, allowing a species with a limited range to suddenly expand to fill all the available habitat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirkpatrick","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Barton","given":"N.

GloNAF represents a data compendium on the occurrence and identity of naturalized alien vascular plant taxa across geographic regions (e.g. countries, states, provinces, districts, islands) around the globe. The dataset includes 13,939 taxa and covers 1,029 regions (including 381 islands). The dataset is based on 210 data sources. For each taxon-by-region combination, we provide information on whether the taxon is considered to be naturalized in the specific region (i.e. has established self-sustaining populations in the wild). Non-native taxa are marked as “alien”, when it is not clear whether they are naturalized. To facilitate alignment with other plant databases, we provide for each taxon the name as given in the original data source and the standardized taxon and family names used by The Plant List Version 1.1 (http://www.theplantlist.org/). We provide an ESRI shapefile including polygons for each region and information on whether it is an island or a mainland region, the country and the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG) regions it is part of (TDWG levels 1–4). We also provide several variables that can be used to filter the data according to quality and completeness of alien taxon lists, which vary among the combinations of regions and data sources. A previous version of the GloNAF dataset (version 1.1) has already been used in several studies on, for example, historical spatial flows of taxa between continents and geographical patterns and determinants of naturalization across different taxonomic groups.

  {"id":"KoellingEtAl_2011","abstract":"Self-fertilization is a common mating system in plants and is known to reduce genetic diversity, increase genetic structure and potentially put populations at greater risk of extinction. In this study, we measured the genetic diversity and structure of two cedar glade endemic species, Leavenworthia alabamica and L. crassa. These species have self-incompatible (SI) and self-compatible (SC) populations and are therefore ideal for understanding how the mating system affects genetic diversity and structure. We found that L. alabamica and L. crassa had high species-level genetic diversity (He=0.229 and 0.183, respectively) and high genetic structure among their populations (FST=0.45 and 0.36, respectively), but that mean genetic diversity was significantly lower in SC compared with SI populations (SC vs SI, He for L. alabamica was 0.065 vs 0.206 and for L. crassa was 0.084 vs 0.189). We also found significant genetic structure using maximum-likelihood clustering methods. These data indicate that the loss of SI leads to the loss of genetic diversity within populations. In addition, we examined genetic distance relationships between SI and SC populations to analyze possible population history and origins of self-compatibility. We find there may have been multiple origins of self-compatibility in L. alabamica and L. crassa. However, further work is required to test this hypothesis. Finally, given their high genetic structure and that individual populations harbor unique alleles, conservation strategies seeking to maximize species-level genetic diversity for these or similar species should protect multiple populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Koelling","given":"V.

  {"id":"KozlovEtAl_2021","abstract":"Herbaria were recently advertised as reliable sources of information regarding historical changes in plant traits and biotic interactions. To justify the use of herbaria in global change research, we asked whether the characteristics of herbarium specimens have changed during the past centuries and whether these changes were due to shifts in plant collection practices.We measured nine characteristics from 515 herbarium specimens of common European trees and large shrubs collected from 1558 to 2016. We asked botanists to rank these specimens by their scientific quality, and asked artists to rank these specimens by their beauty.Eight of 11 assessed characteristics of herbarium specimens changed significantly during the study period. The average number of leaves in plant specimens increased 3-fold, whereas the quality of specimen preparation decreased. Leaf size negatively correlated with leaf number in specimens in both among-species and within-species analyses. The proportion of herbarium sheets containing plant reproductive structures peaked in the 1850s. The scientific value of herbarium specimens increased until the 1700s, but then did not change, whereas their aesthetic value showed no systematic trends.Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that many characteristics of herbarium specimens have changed systematically and substantially from the 16th to 21st centuries due to changes in plant collection and preservation practices.

  {"id":"LakeEtAl_2020","abstract":"Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to forecast potential range expansion of invasive species. However, invasive species occurrence datasets often have spatial biases that may violate key SDM assumptions. In this study, we examined alternative methods of spatial bias correction and multiple methods for model evaluation for seven invasive plant species. Location North America. Taxon Common Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), Wild Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), Leafy Spurge (Euphorbia virgata), Common Teasel (Dipsacus fullonum), Brown Knapweed (Centaurea jacea), Black Swallowwort (Vincetoxicum nigrum) and Dalmatian Toadflax (Linaria dalmatica). Methods We employed bias-correction measures for both occurrence sampling and background sampling inputs in a factorial design for Maxent resulting in six potential models for each species. We evaluated our models for complexity, model fit and using commonly employed evaluation metrics: AUC, partial AUC, the continuous Boyce index and sensitivity. We then developed a structured process for model selection. Results Models developed without occurrence or background bias correction often were overly complex and did not transfer well to expanding range fronts. Conversely, models that employed occurrence and/or background bias-correction measures were less complex, had better AICc scores and had greater projection into incipient areas. These simpler models were also more likely to be selected when evaluated using a process that integrated multiple evaluation metrics. We found that invasion history (e.g. established versus incipient) was associated with the effectiveness of spatial bias correction techniques. Main Conclusions While challenges exist in building climate-based correlative species distribution models for invasive species, we found that methods relying on maximizing AUC performed poorly for invasive species. We advocate for the use of multiple and diverse metrics for model evaluation. Users of species distribution models need to incorporate explicit consideration of model discrimination, model fit and model complexity into their decision-making processes if they are to build biologically realistic models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lake","given":"Thomas A."},{"family":"Runquist","given":"Ryan D.

  {"id":"LambertEtAl_2016","abstract":"The environmental and social impacts of Phragmites australis invasion have been extensively studied in the eastern United States. In the West where the invasion is relatively recent, a lack of information on distributions and spread has limited our ability to manage invasive populations or assess whether native populations will experience a decline similar to that in the East. Between 2006 and 2015, we evaluated the genetic status, distribution, and soil properties (pH, electrical conductivity, and soil texture) of Phragmites stands in wetlands and riparian systems throughout the Southwest. Native (subspecies americanus), Introduced (haplotype M), and Gulf Coast (subspecies berlandieri) Phragmites lineages were identified in the survey region, as well as watershed-scale hybridization between the Native and Introduced lineages in southern Nevada. Two Asian haplotypes (P and Q) that were previously not known to occur in North America were found in California. The Native lineage was the most frequent and widespread across the region, with four cpDNA haplotypes (A, B, H, and AR) occurring at low densities in all wetland types. Most Introduced Phragmites stands were in or near major urban centers and associated with anthropogenic disturbance in wetlands and rivers, and we document their spread in the region, which is likely facilitated by transportation and urban development. Soil pH of Native and hybrid stands was higher (averaging 8.3 and 8.6, respectively) than Introduced stands (pH of 7.5) and was the only soil property that differed among lineages. Continued monitoring of all Phragmites lineages in the Southwest will aid in assessing the conservation status of Native populations and developing management priorities for non-native stands.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Lambert","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Saltonstall","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Long","given":"Randy"},{"family":"Dudley","given":"Tom L."}],"citation-key":"LambertEtAl_2016","container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-016-1164-8","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2597-2617","source":"Springer Link","title":"Biogeography of Phragmites australis lineages in the southwestern United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1164-8","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"LawsonEtAl_2012","abstract":"1. There is a pressing need to understand how to facilitate species’ range shifts under climate change. However, few empirical studies are available to inform decision-making, particularly at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. 2. We present a case study of a thermally constrained habitat specialist, the silver-spotted skipper butterfly Hesperia comma, at its expanding range margin in south-eastern Britain. Using data from 724 habitat patches over a 9-year interval (2000–2009), we examined local and landscape determinants of colonization, survival and population density. We then predicted probabilities of colonization and survival for habitat patches under the observed 1982 and 2009 distributions to investigate how the factors limiting range expansions change through space and time. 3. Between 2000 and 2009, Hesperia comma continued to expand its range in Britain, but the 67 recorded colonization events were offset by 48 local extinctions. Extinctions were strongly linked to climate, occurring predominantly in cooler regions and on shaded north-facing slopes. 4. Population density and probability of survival were closely related to conditions within a site, whereas probability of colonization was largely determined by functional connectivity. Survival probability was also influenced by connectivity, suggesting that immigration helped to support extinction-prone populations (a ‘rescue effect’). 5. Patch occupancy beyond the range margin was primarily constrained by colonization, but close to the expanding front, population survival became the key limiting factor. This pattern was conserved during range expansion, altering management priorities at individual sites. 6. Synthesis and applications. Previous studies on facilitating range shifts have stressed the need to increase landscape-scale connectivity to remove constraints on colonization, and our data substantiate this advice. However, we show that enhancing population survival can also help to facilitate range expansions, because populations at leading range edges face high extinction risk. Population survival can be improved directly through local management actions, such as enlarging patch size and increasing habitat quality, or indirectly by improving connectivity. Thus, local management can secure vulnerable populations at the range edge and provide larger and more stable migrant sources for future expansion and deserves consideration when facilitating range shifts under climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lawson","given":"Callum R."},{"family":"Bennie","given":"Jonathan J."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Chris D."},{"family":"Hodgson","given":"Jenny A."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"LawsonEtAl_2012","container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02098.x","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02098.x","page":"552-561","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Local and landscape management of an expanding range margin under climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02098.x","volume":"49"},
  {"id":"Lazaro-NogalEtAl_2017","abstract":"The effect of population size on population genetic diversity and structure has rarely been studied jointly with other factors such as the position of a population within the species’ distribution range or the presence of mutualistic partners influencing dispersal. Understanding these determining factors for genetic variation is critical for conservation of relict plants that are generally suffering from genetic deterioration. Working with 16 populations of the vulnerable relict shrub Cneorum tricoccon throughout the majority of its western Mediterranean distribution range, and using nine polymorphic microsatellite markers, we examined the effects of periphery (peripheral vs. central), population size (large vs. small), and seed disperser (introduced carnivores vs. endemic lizards) on the genetic diversity and population structure of the species. Contrasting genetic variation (HE: 0.04–0.476) was found across populations. Peripheral populations showed lower genetic diversity, but this was dependent on population size. Large peripheral populations showed high levels of genetic diversity, whereas small central populations were less diverse. Significant isolation by distance was detected, indicating that the effect of long-distance gene flow is limited relative to that of genetic drift, probably due to high selfing rates (FIS = 0.155–0.887), restricted pollen flow, and ineffective seed dispersal. Bayesian clustering also supported the strong population differentiation and highly fragmented structure. Contrary to expectations, the type of disperser showed no significant effect on either population genetic diversity or structure. Our results challenge the idea of an effect of periphery per se that can be mainly explained by population size, drawing attention to the need of integrative approaches considering different determinants of genetic variation. Furthermore, the very low genetic diversity observed in several small populations and the strong among-population differentiation highlight the conservation value of large populations throughout the species’ range, particularly in light of climate change and direct human threats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Lázaro‐Nogal","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Matesanz","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"García‐Fernández","given":"Alfredo"},{"family":"Traveset","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Valladares","given":"Fernando"}],"citation-key":"Lazaro-NogalEtAl_2017","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2940","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.2940","page":"7231-7242","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Population size, center–periphery, and seed dispersers’ effects on the genetic diversity and population structure of the Mediterranean relict shrub Cneorum tricoccon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.2940","volume":"7"},

Specifically, we asked whether range limits coincide with predicted niche limits in this system and whether the suitability of sites declines towards the edge of the species’ range in North America. We further explored patterns of environmental change towards the edge of the range and asked whether genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity decline with increasing peripherality and environmental marginality. Our results suggest that latitudinal range limits coincide with niche limits. Populations experienced increasingly marginal environments towards these limits – though patterns of environmental change were more complex than most theoretical models for range limits assume. Genomic diversity declined towards the edge of the species’ range and with increasing distance from the estimated centre of the species’ niche in environmental space, but not with the suitability of sites based on niche model predictions.

Among 184 individuals, 162 different genotypes were identified. The overall unbiased gene diversity was high (). A high level of genetic differentiation among populations (FST = 0.45; p < .01) indicated restricted gene flow between populations. Using a Bayesian approach, six clusters were found which represented the genetic structure of the studied cloudberry populations. The value of correlation index between genetic and geographical distances (r = .44) indicates that gene flow, even over a long distance, could exist. An exact test of population differentiation showed that Rubus chamaemorus populations from regions (Krkonose Mountains, continental Norway and Spitsbergen) are differentiated although some individuals within populations share common alleles even among regions. These results were confirmed by AMOVA, where the highest level of diversity was found within populations (70.8%). There was no difference between 87 pairs of populations (18.7%) mostly within cloudberry populations from continental Norway and from Spitsbergen. Based on obtained results, it is possible to conclude that Czech and Norwegian cloudberry populations are undergoing differentiation, which preserves unique allele compositions most likely from original populations during the last glaciation period.

Yet, our knowledge of the coupling between species range shifts and isotherm shifts remains limited. Here, we introduce BioShifts—a global geo-database of 30,534 range shifts. Despite a spatial imbalance towards the most developed regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a taxonomic bias towards the most charismatic animals and plants of the planet, data show that marine species are better at tracking isotherm shifts, and move towards the pole six times faster than terrestrial species. More specifically, we find that marine species closely track shifting isotherms in warm and relatively undisturbed waters (for example, the Central Pacific Basin) or in cold waters subject to high human pressures (for example, the North Sea). On land, human activities impede the capacity of terrestrial species to track isotherm shifts in latitude, with some species shifting in the opposite direction to isotherms. Along elevational gradients, species follow the direction of isotherm shifts but at a pace that is much slower than expected, especially in areas with warm climates. Our results suggest that terrestrial species are lagging behind shifting isotherms more than marine species, which is probably related to the interplay between the wider thermal safety margin of terrestrial versus marine species and the more constrained physical environment for dispersal in terrestrial versus marine habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lenoir","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Bertrand","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Comte","given":"Lise"},{"family":"Bourgeaud","given":"Luana"},{"family":"Hattab","given":"Tarek"},{"family":"Murienne","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Grenouillet","given":"Gaël"}],"citation-key":"LenoirEtAl_2020","container-title":"Nature Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1038/s41559-020-1198-2","ISSN":"2397-334X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,25]]},"language":"en","page":"1-16","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Species better track climate warming in the oceans than on land","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1198-2"},

Populations occurring on the edge of a species' range tend to be smaller, more isolated, and more genetically and ecologically divergent than central populations. The combination of these characteristics can impart novel evolutionary potential and local ecological significance, thus heightening their conservation value, while also making them less viable and more prone to local extinction. Public policy supports the conservation of peripheral populations, despite the commonness of the species elsewhere. However, the conservation of significant peripheral populations of nonlisted plants has been arbitrary and ineffective. The absence of explicit criteria to determine the conservation value of peripheral plant populations, the lack of finer-scale data on plant distributions, and a general unawareness of their value have hindered efforts to conserve them.

  {"id":"LeroyEtAl_2016","abstract":"virtualspecies is a freely available package for R designed to generate virtual species distributions, a procedure increasingly used in ecology to improve species distribution models. This package combines the existing methodological approaches with the objective of generating virtual species distributions with increased ecological realism. The package includes 1) generating the probability of occurrence of a virtual species from a spatial set of environmental conditions (i.e. environmental suitability), with two different approaches; 2) converting the environmental suitability into presence–absence with a probabilistic approach; 3) introducing dispersal limitations in the realised virtual species distributions and 4) sampling occurrences with different biases in the sampling procedure. The package was designed to be extremely flexible, to allow users to simulate their own defined species–environment relationships, as well as to provide a fine control over every simulation parameter.

We consider under what conditions it is appropriate to expend resources to protect these populations. The conservation value of peripheral populations depends upon their genetic divergence from other conspecific populations. Peripheral populations are expected to diverge from central populations as a result of the interwoven effects of isolation, genetic drift, and natural selection. Available empirical evidence suggests that peripheral populations are often genetically and morphologically divergent from central populations. The long-term conservation of species is likely to depend upon the protection of genetically distinct populations. In addition, peripheral populations are potentially important sites of future speciation events. Under some circumstances, conservation of peripheral populations may be beneficial to the protection of the evolutionary process and the environmental systems that are likely to generate future evolutionary diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lesica","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Allendorf","given":"Fred W."}],"citation-key":"LesicaAllendorf_1995","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09040753.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09040753.x","page":"753-760","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"When are peripheral populations valuable for conservation?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09040753.x","volume":"9"},

One hypothesis predicts that natural populations at geographic range margins will have lower genetic diversity relative to those located centrally in species? distributions owing to a link between geographic and environmental marginality; alternatively, genetic variation may be unrelated with geographic marginality via decoupling of geographic and environmental marginality. We investigate the predictivity of geographic patterns of genetic variation based on geographic and environmental marginality using published genetic diversity data for 40 species (insects, plants, birds, mammals, worms). Only about half of species showed positive relationships between geographic and environmental marginality.

  {"id":"LiuEtAl_2020a","abstract":"The ecological niche is a key concept for elucidating patterns of species distributions and developing strategies for conserving biodiversity. However, recent times are seeing a widespread debate whether species niches are conserved across space and time (niche conservatism hypothesis). Biological invasions represent a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in a short time frame at the global scale. We synthesized empirical findings for 434 invasive species from 86 studies to assess whether invasive species conserve their climatic niche between native and introduced ranges. Although the niche conservatism hypothesis was rejected in most studies, highly contrasting conclusions for the same species between and within studies suggest that the dichotomous conclusions of these studies were sensitive to techniques, assessment criteria, or author preferences. We performed a consistent quantitative analysis of the dynamics between native and introduced climatic niches reported by previous studies. Our results show there is very limited niche expansion between native and introduced ranges, and introduced niches occupy a position similar to native niches in the environmental space. These findings support the niche conservatism hypothesis overall. In particular, introduced niches were narrower for terrestrial animals, species introduced more recently, or species with more native occurrences. Niche similarity was lower for aquatic species, species introduced only intentionally or more recently, or species with fewer introduced occurrences. Climatic niche conservatism for invasive species not only increases our confidence in transferring ecological niche models to new ranges but also supports the use of niche models for forecasting species responses to changing climates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Chunlong"},{"family":"Wolter","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Xian","given":"Weiwei"},{"family":"Jeschke","given":"Jonathan M."}],"citation-key":"LiuEtAl_2020a","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2004289117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"38","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,22]]},"language":"en","page":"23643-23651","PMID":"32883880","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Most invasive species largely conserve their climatic niche","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/38/23643","volume":"117"},

In this manuscript we review some of the features of this measure and bring into question its reliability as a comparative measure of accuracy between model results. We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lobo","given":"Jorge M."},{"family":"Jiménez‐Valverde","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Real","given":"Raimundo"}],"citation-key":"LoboEtAl_2008","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00358.x","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00358.x","page":"145-151","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"AUC: a misleading measure of the performance of predictive distribution models","title-short":"AUC","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00358.x","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"LoEtAl_2009","abstract":"Polyploidy and gametophytic apomixis are two important and associated processes in plants. Many hawthorn species are polyploids and can reproduce both sexually and apomictically. However, the population genetic structure of these species is poorly understood. Crataegus douglasii is represented exclusively by self-compatible tetraploid pseudogamous apomicts across North America, whereas Crataegus suksdorfii found in the Pacific Northwest is known to include self-incompatible diploid sexuals as well as polyploid apomicts. We compare population structure and genetic variability in these two closely related taxa using microsatellite and chloroplast sequence markers. Using 13 microsatellite loci located on four linkage groups, 251 alleles were detected in 239 individuals sampled from 15 localities. Within-population multilocus genotypic variation and molecular diversity are greatest in diploid sexuals and lowest in triploid apomicts. Apart from the isolation of eastern North American populations of C. douglasii, there is little evidence of isolation by distance in this taxon. Genetic diversity in western populations of C. douglasii suggests that gene flow is frequent, and that colonization and establishment are often successful. In contrast, local populations of C. suksdorfii are more markedly differentiated. Gene flow appears to be limited primarily by distance in diploids and by apomixis and self-compatibility in polyploids. We infer that apomixis and reproductive barriers between cytotypes are factors that reduce the frequency of gene flow among populations, and may ultimately lead to allopatric speciation in C. suksdorfii. Our findings shed light on evolution in woody plants that show heterogeneous ploidy levels and reproductive systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lo","given":"Eugenia Y.

  {"id":"MagareyEtAl_2018","abstract":"This study compares four models for predicting the potential distribution of non-indigenous weed species in the conterminous U.S. The comparison focused on evaluating modeling tools and protocols as currently used for weed risk assessment or for predicting the potential distribution of invasive weeds. We used six weed species (three highly invasive and three less invasive non-indigenous species) that have been established in the U.S. for more than 75 years. The experiment involved providing non-U. S. location data to users familiar with one of the four evaluated techniques, who then developed predictive models that were applied to the United States without knowing the identity of the species or its U.S. distribution. We compared a simple GIS climate matching technique known as Proto3, a simple climate matching tool CLIMEX Match Climates, the correlative model MaxEnt, and a process model known as the Thornley Transport Resistance (TTR) model. Two experienced users ran each modeling tool except TTR, which had one user. Models were trained with global species distribution data excluding any U.S. data, and then were evaluated using the current known U.S. distribution. The influence of weed species identity and modeling tool on prevalence and sensitivity effects was compared using a generalized linear mixed model. Each modeling tool itself had a low statistical significance, while weed species alone accounted for 69.1 and 48.5% of the variance for prevalence and sensitivity, respectively. These results suggest that simple modeling tools might perform as well as complex ones in the case of predicting potential distribution for a weed not yet present in the United States. Considerations of model accuracy should also be balanced with those of reproducibility and ease of use. More important than the choice of modeling tool is the construction of robust protocols and testing both new and experienced users under blind test conditions that approximate operational conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Magarey","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Newton","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Seung Cheon"},{"family":"Takeuchi","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Christie","given":"David"},{"family":"Jarnevich","given":"Catherine S."},{"family":"Kohl","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Damus","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Higgins","given":"Steven I."},{"family":"Millar","given":"Leah"},{"family":"Castro","given":"Karen"},{"family":"West","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Hastings","given":"John"},{"family":"Cook","given":"Gericke"},{"family":"Kartesz","given":"John"},{"family":"Koop","given":"Anthony L."}],"citation-key":"MagareyEtAl_2018","container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-017-1567-1","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"679-694","source":"Springer Link","title":"Comparison of four modeling tools for the prediction of potential distribution for non-indigenous weeds in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1567-1","volume":"20"},

The Green Revolution has played a key role in the past century by increasing agricultural productivity worldwide, however, limited availability and continued depletion of natural resources such as arable land and water will continue to pose a serious challenge for global food security in the coming decades. High yielding varieties with proven tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, superior nutritional profiles, and the ability to adapt to the changing environment are needed for continued agricultural sustainability. The narrow genetic base of modern cultivars is becoming a major bottleneck for crop improvement efforts and, therefore, the use of crop wild relatives (CWRs) is a promising approach to enhance genetic diversity of cultivated crops. This article provides a review of the efforts to date on the exploration of CWRs as a source of tolerance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses in four global crops of importance; maize, rice, cotton, and soybean. In addition to the overview of the repertoire and geographical spread of CWRs in each of the respective crops, we have provided a comprehensive discussion on the morphological and/or genetic basis of the traits along with some examples, when available, of the research in the transfer of traits from CWRs to cultivated varieties. The emergence of modern molecular and genomic technologies has not only accelerated the pace of dissecting the genetics underlying the traits found in CWRs, but also enabled rapid and efficient trait transfer and genome manipulation. The potential and promise of these technologies has also been highlighted in this review.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Mammadov","given":"Jafar"},{"family":"Buyyarapu","given":"Ramesh"},{"family":"Guttikonda","given":"Satish K."},{"family":"Parliament","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Abdurakhmonov","given":"Ibrokhim Y."},{"family":"Kumpatla","given":"Siva P."}],"citation-key":"MammadovEtAl_2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","DOI":"10.3389/fpls.2018.00886","ISSN":"1664-462X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"886","source":"Frontiers","title":"Wild Relatives of Maize, Rice, Cotton, and Soybean: Treasure Troves for Tolerance to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses","title-short":"Wild Relatives of Maize, Rice, Cotton, and Soybean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2018.00886","volume":"9"},

This variation reflects, in part, differences in ecological tolerance among taxa, but the influence of phylogeny and evolutionary divergence through genome duplication remains controversial. 2. Here, we examine the evolutionary sources of variation in species range area, latitudinal position and overlap, and six range climatic variables (maximum, minimum and breadth of temperature and precipitation) for North American angiosperms. We sampled two diploid and one polyploid species from each of 144 genera and examined sources of variation in a nested taxonomic analysis and congeneric species pairs comparison. 3. For all range characteristics studied, a significant portion of the variance among species (mean 53%, range 37–60%) was attributable to taxonomic membership above species (i.e. genus, family and order). Four of the seven range attributes were significantly correlated between diploid congeners (e.g. range area rs = 0.65) and between heteroploid (diploid and polyploid) congeners (e.g. range area rs = 0.62). The strength of correlations between heteroploid relatives was not consistently different than correlations between diploids. 4. No differences in mean range breadth (range area, temperature breadth, precipitation breadth) or climatological position (minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation) were observed between diploid and polyploid congeners.

  {"id":"MartinussenEtAl_2010","abstract":"In this study we investigated the interaction between temperature and genotype on fruit development and levels of total phenols and anthocyanins in cloudberry. The experiment was done in a phytotron using one female (‘Fjellgull') and one hermaphroditic (‘Nyby') cultivar. Plants were grown at 9, 12, 15 and 18°C in 24-h photoperiod. The female cultivars were pollinated with pollen from a male (‘Apollen') clone and from the hermaphrodite clone. Parthenocarpic fruit development was induced by gibberellic acid (GA3 ). Ripe berries were frozen individually at −80°C and stored until analyses. There was a linear, double logarithmic relationship between temperature and number of days from pollination/GA3 -treatment to ripening. ‘Fjellgull' had significantly larger berries than ‘Nyby', and the largest berries were obtained at 12 and 9°C. Pollen clone did not have a significant effect on berry size. GA3 induced parthenogenesis in ‘Fjellgull' and partial parthenogenesis in ‘Nyby'. In ‘Fjellgull', the parthenocarpic berries were comparable to pollinated ones at low temperatures, but at 18°C their development was restricted. The level of total anthocyanins was significantly higher in ‘Fjellgull' than in ‘Nyby', and these levels were significantly enhanced at 9 and 12°C compared to higher temperatures. Levels of total phenolic compounds were not significantly affected. In conclusion, the present results indicate that low temperature is favourable both for size and quality of cloudberries.","author":[{"family":"Martinussen","given":"Inger"},{"family":"Uleberg","given":"Eivind"},{"family":"McDougall","given":"Gordon J."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Derek"},{"family":"Junttila","given":"Olavi"}],"citation-key":"MartinussenEtAl_2010","container-title":"Journal of Berry Research","DOI":"10.3233/BR-2010-010","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"91-101","publisher":"IOS Press","title":"Development and quality of cloudberry (<i>Rubus chamaemorus</i> L.) as affected by female parent, male parent and temperature","type":"article-journal","volume":"1"},

These taxa are directly associated with wealth creation and food security as they include the wild crop progenitors possessing many beneficial traits that can be bred into crops to address the changing environmental and market demands. These species are being eroded yet they have been widely neglected by national agencies because agricultural agencies generally have no responsibility for conservation and ecological conservation agencies tend to focus their efforts on habitat or rare and threatened taxa conservation. If the CBD 2010 target is to be achieved for CWR taxa there is a need for a complex interdisciplinary approach that outlines what diversity is present, what threatens that diversity and how it might be best conserved for use by future generations. When attempting to address these issues within the United Kingdom several key topics were identified: (1) creation of a national CWR inventory, (2) analysis of the national CWR inventory content, (3) national patterns of CWR distribution, (4) threat status for CWR diversity, (5) assessment of current conservation actions, (6) identification of priority sites for CWR conservation, and (7) creation of CWR conservation action plans.

  {"id":"MaxtedEtAl_2008","abstract":"Aim Gap analysis is a well-established conservation technique that identifies areas in which selected elements of biodiversity are represented and through comparison with existing in situ protected area networks identifies habitats or ecosystems that need additional protection. We aim to demonstrate that gap analysis may be extended to encompass both in situ and ex situ genetic diversity conservation strategies. Location Global, with exemplar case study from sub-Saharan Africa. Methods An extended methodology of gap analysis is proposed that involves the following steps: (1) circumscription of target taxon and target area; (2) assessment of natural diversity through a review of intrinsic taxonomic, genetic and ecogeographical diversity combined with threat assessment; (3) assessment of current complementary in situ and ex situ conservation strategies; and (4) reformulation of the conservation strategy through analysis of the differences between the pattern of natural, intrinsic diversity and the elements of that diversity already effectively represented by existing in situ and ex situ conservation actions. Results To illustrate the gap analysis approach proposed, the methodology was applied to the conservation of African Vigna species (cowpea Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. and its wild relatives) and indicated: (1) genetic reserves should be established at the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika, the coastal area of Sierra Leone and between Lake Victoria and the other Great Lakes, and (2) 14 taxa and several countries should be targeted for further seed collection. Main conclusions The robust nature of the extended methodology for gap analysis has been demonstrated and indicates that its scope as an effective conservation tool may be expanded to fully address the need for a more comprehensive and complementary conservation strategy that encompasses both in situ and ex situ applications. However, it should be stressed that the methodology is applicable for any form of biodiversity (wild or cultivated), where the conservation of genetic diversity is the prime goal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Maxted","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Dulloo","given":"Ehsan"},{"family":"Ford-Lloyd","given":"Brian V."},{"family":"Iriondo","given":"Jose M."},{"family":"Jarvis","given":"Andy"}],"citation-key":"MaxtedEtAl_2008","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00512.x","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00512.x","page":"1018-1030","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Gap analysis: a tool for complementary genetic conservation assessment","title-short":"Gap analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00512.x","volume":"14"},

Crop wild relatives are species closely related to crops, including their progenitors, which have the potential to contribute beneficial traits for crop improvement, such as biotic and abiotic resistances, leading to improved yield and stability. Having already made major contributions to crop improvement in the 20th century, CWR are recognized as a critical resource to sustain global food security; therefore, their systematic conservation is imperative. However, extending their conservation and promoting more systematic exploitation is hindered by a lack of understanding of their current and potential value, their diversity, and practically how they might be conserved. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to (i) demonstrate the current and potential use of CWR in crop improvement, (ii) estimate how many CWR species exist and how many are a global priority for active conservation, and (iii) describe how a global network for the in situ conservation of CWR might be established that could help to underpin future food security.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Maxted","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Kell","given":"Shelagh"},{"family":"Ford-Lloyd","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Dulloo","given":"Ehsan"},{"family":"Toledo","given":"Álvaro"}],"citation-key":"MaxtedEtAl_2012","container-title":"Crop Science","DOI":"10.2135/cropsci2011.08.0415","ISSN":"1435-0653","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2135/cropsci2011.08.0415","page":"774-785","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Toward the Systematic Conservation of Global Crop Wild Relative Diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2135/cropsci2011.08.0415","volume":"52"},

For both the national and global approaches, it would be desirable to include all CWR diversity present. The initial step in the development of a conservation strategy is to generate a CWR checklist which in turn consists of four distinct types of CWR databases.

Modern human land use has created a mosaic of habitats in many landscapes, including the landscape of the northeastern United States. European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) is an exotic plant that has achieved varying success in North American habitats. We studied dispersal, seed survival, germination, and seedling survival of buckthorn populations at four plots in each of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forests, old fields, and abandoned conifer plantations in central New York State. Dispersal was low in maple forests, as evidenced by low collection rates of R. cathartica seeds in seed traps. Rates of post-dispersal seed predation were highest in maple forests and lowest in old fields, suggesting greater use of maple forests by granivorous rodents. Germination rates did not vary among seeds planted in soils of these habitats when studied in the laboratory despite differences in soil pH. Survival of transplanted seedlings was low in maple forests relative to old fields and plantations. Buckthorn invasion of old fields and abandoned plantations was not strongly constrained by factors we considered, and the buckthorn populations in these habitats were large. A combination of low dispersal by frugivores, low seed survival due to predation, and low seedling survival due to dim light conditions apparently prevents R. cathartica from invasion of intact maple forests of our area.

The model vastly improves gene flow predictions because it simultaneously integrates all possible pathways connecting populations. When applied to data from threatened mammal and tree species, the model consistently outperformed conventional gene flow models, revealing that barriers were less important in structuring populations than previously thought.

  {"id":"MeirmansEtAl_2018","abstract":"Though polyploidy is an important aspect of the evolutionary genetics of both plants and animals, the development of population genetic theory of polyploids has seriously lagged behind that of diploids. This is unfortunate since the analysis of polyploid genetic data—and the interpretation of the results—requires even more scrutiny than with diploid data. This is because of several polyploidy-specific complications in segregation and genotyping such as tetrasomy, double reduction, and missing dosage information. Here, we review the theoretical and statistical aspects of the population genetics of polyploids. We discuss several widely used types of inferences, including genetic diversity, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, population differentiation, genetic distance, and detecting population structure. For each, we point out how the statistical approach, expected result, and interpretation differ between different ploidy levels. We also discuss for each type of inference what biases may arise from the polyploid-specific complications and how these biases can be overcome. From our overview, it is clear that the statistical toolbox that is available for the analysis of genetic data is flexible and still expanding. Modern sequencing techniques will soon be able to overcome some of the current limitations to the analysis of polyploid data, though the techniques are lagging behind those available for diploids. Furthermore, the availability of more data may aggravate the biases that can arise, and increase the risk of false inferences. Therefore, simulations such as we used throughout this review are an important tool to verify the results of analyses of polyploid genetic data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Meirmans","given":"Patrick G"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shenglin"},{"family":"Tienderen","given":"Peter H","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"MeirmansEtAl_2018","container-title":"Journal of Heredity","container-title-short":"Journal of Heredity","DOI":"10.1093/jhered/esy006","ISSN":"0022-1503","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,16]]},"page":"283-296","source":"Silverchair","title":"The Analysis of Polyploid Genetic Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esy006","volume":"109"},

We develop general grid-based, pattern-oriented spread models incorporating three mechanisms—plant population growth, local dispersal, and long-distance dispersal—to predict broadscale spread patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. We use the model to examine the spread of the invasive Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) by Sturnus vulgaris (European starling) across northeastern North America. We find excellent quantitative agreement with historical spread records over the last century that are critically linked to the geometry of heterogeneous landscapes and each of the explanatory mechanisms considered. Spread of bittersweet before 1960 was primarily driven by high growth rates in developed and agricultural landscapes, while subsequent spread was mediated by expansion into deciduous and coniferous forests. Large, continuous patches of coniferous forests may substantially impede invasion.

MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt’s calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt’s outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Merow","given":"Cory"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Silander","given":"John A."}],"citation-key":"MerowEtAl_2013","container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x","page":"1058-1069","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A practical guide to MaxEnt for modeling species’ distributions: what it does, and why inputs and settings matter","title-short":"A practical guide to MaxEnt for modeling species’ distributions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"MerowEtAl_2017","abstract":"Forecasting ecological responses to climate change, invasion, and their interaction must rely on understanding underlying mechanisms. However, such forecasts require extrapolation into new locations and environments. We linked demography and environment using experimental biogeography to forecast invasive and native species’ potential ranges under present and future climate in New England, United States to overcome issues of extrapolation in novel environments. We studied two potentially nonequilibrium invasive plants’ distributions, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), each paired with their native ecological analogs to better understand demographic drivers of invasions. Our models predict that climate change will considerably reduce establishment of a currently prolific invader (A. petiolata) throughout New England driven by poor demographic performance in warmer climates. In contrast, invasion of B. thunbergii will be facilitated because of higher growth and germination in warmer climates, with higher likelihood to establish farther north and in closed canopy habitats in the south. Invasion success is in high fecundity for both invasive species and demographic compensation for A. petiolata relative to native analogs. For A. petiolata, simulations suggest that eradication efforts would require unrealistic efficiency; hence, management should focus on inhibiting spread into colder, currently unoccupied areas, understanding source–sink dynamics, and understanding community dynamics should A. petiolata (which is allelopathic) decline. Our results—based on considerable differences with correlative occurrence models typically used for such biogeographic forecasts—suggest the urgency of incorporating mechanism into range forecasting and invasion management to understand how climate change may alter current invasion patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Merow","given":"Cory"},{"family":"Bois","given":"Sarah Treanor"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Jenica M."},{"family":"Xie","given":"Yingying"},{"family":"Silander","given":"John A."}],"citation-key":"MerowEtAl_2017","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1609633114","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,18]]},"language":"en","page":"E3276-E3284","PMID":"28348212","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Climate change both facilitates and inhibits invasive plant ranges in New England","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/16/E3276","volume":"114"},

It defines a species' realized niche in a biological community, its fundamental niche as determined by physiology, and its potential niche—the fundamental niche in a given environment or geographic space. However, most predictions of the effects of climate change on species' distributions are limited to correlative models of the realized niche, which assume that species are in distributional equilibrium with respect to the variables or gradients included in the model. Here, I present a mechanistic niche model that measures species' responses to major seasonal temperature gradients that interact with the physiology of the organism. I then use lethal physiological temperatures to parameterize the model for bird species in North and South America and show that most focal bird species are not in direct physiological equilibrium with the gradients. Results also show that most focal bird species possess broad thermal tolerances encompassing novel climates that could become available with climate change. I conclude with discussion of how mechanistic niche models may be used to (i) gain insights into the processes that cause species to respond to climate change and (ii) build more accurate correlative distribution models in birds and other species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Monahan","given":"William B."}],"citation-key":"Monahan_2009","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0007921","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11,20]]},"language":"en","page":"e7921","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A Mechanistic Niche Model for Measuring Species' Distributional Responses to Seasonal Temperature Gradients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007921","volume":"4"},

Assessing genetic variation within and among populations of imperiled species is key to the development of effective conservation management strategies.

In this study, we assessed genetic diversity in natural and reintroduced populations of Pyne’s ground plum (Astragalus bibullatus; Fabaceae), a plant species narrowly endemic to the limestone glades of Middle Tennessee, USA. Using seven nuclear microsatellite loci to survey six natural and three recently introduced populations, we found evidence for moderate diversity within and limited diversity among populations, with no evidence for inbreeding or recent bottlenecks. All three reintroduced populations exhibited effective number of alleles and mean expected and observed heterozygosities similar to those recovered for natural populations, indicating that the current reintroduction program has successfully captured the breadth of observed variation. One geographically disjunct natural population exhibited the greatest genetic divergence relative to all other populations and should be considered a primary target for future conservation management efforts.

  {"id":"MuscarellaEtAl_2014","abstract":"Recent studies have demonstrated a need for increased rigour in building and evaluating ecological niche models (ENMs) based on presence-only occurrence data. Two major goals are to balance goodness-of-fit with model complexity (e.g. by ‘tuning’ model settings) and to evaluate models with spatially independent data. These issues are especially critical for data sets suffering from sampling bias, and for studies that require transferring models across space or time (e.g. responses to climate change or spread of invasive species). Efficient implementation of procedures to accomplish these goals, however, requires automation. We developed ENMeval, an R package that: (i) creates data sets for k-fold cross-validation using one of several methods for partitioning occurrence data (including options for spatially independent partitions), (ii) builds a series of candidate models using Maxent with a variety of user-defined settings and (iii) provides multiple evaluation metrics to aid in selecting optimal model settings. The six methods for partitioning data are n−1 jackknife, random k-folds ( = bins), user-specified folds and three methods of masked geographically structured folds. ENMeval quantifies six evaluation metrics: the area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic plot for test localities (AUCTEST), the difference between training and testing AUC (AUCDIFF), two different threshold-based omission rates for test localities and the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc). We demonstrate ENMeval by tuning model settings for eight tree species of the genus Coccoloba in Puerto Rico based on AICc. Evaluation metrics varied substantially across model settings, and models selected with AICc differed from default ones. In summary, ENMeval facilitates the production of better ENMs and should promote future methodological research on many outstanding issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Muscarella","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Galante","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Soley‐Guardia","given":"Mariano"},{"family":"Boria","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Kass","given":"Jamie M."},{"family":"Uriarte","given":"María"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Robert P."}],"citation-key":"MuscarellaEtAl_2014","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12261","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12261","page":"1198-1205","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"ENMeval: An R package for conducting spatially independent evaluations and estimating optimal model complexity for Maxent ecological niche models","title-short":"ENMeval","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12261","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"NaimiEtAl_2014","abstract":"Species data held in museum and herbaria, survey data and opportunistically observed data are a substantial information resource. A key challenge in using these data is the uncertainty about where an observation is located. This is important when the data are used for species distribution modelling (SDM), because the coordinates are used to extract the environmental variables and thus, positional error may lead to inaccurate estimation of the species–environment relationship. The magnitude of this effect is related to the level of spatial autocorrelation in the environmental variables. Using local spatial association can be relevant because it can lead to the identification of the specific occurrence records that cause the largest drop in SDM accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we tested whether the SDM predictions are more affected by positional uncertainty originating from locations that have lower local spatial association in their predictors. We performed this experiment for Spain and the Netherlands, using simulated datasets derived from well known species distribution models (SDMs). We used the K statistic to quantify the local spatial association in the predictors at each species occurrence location. A probabilistic approach using Monte Carlo simulations was employed to introduce the error in the species locations. The results revealed that positional uncertainty in species occurrence data at locations with low local spatial association in predictors reduced the prediction accuracy of the SDMs. We propose that local spatial association is a way to identify the species occurrence records that require treatment for positional uncertainty. We also developed and present a tool in the R environment to target observations that are likely to create error in the output from SDMs as a result of positional uncertainty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Naimi","given":"Babak"},{"family":"Hamm","given":"Nicholas A.

In this study, we examine the potential of UAV imagery to track the structural composition and related phenological traits of the dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris on a former military training area. On a European Natura 2000 heathland site, habitat management is shown to be evaluated on the basis of flowering dynamics and reproductive recovery as a proxy of functional changes that are generated after fire destruction. In particular, we utilize true color camera information and digital surface models to determine the spatiotemporal evolution of Calluna life-cycle phases and flowering phenology 2 years after controlled burning. A stepwise methodological framework is presented that extracts Calluna pixels, spatially separates juvenile and mature life-cycle phases, differentiates between generative and vegetative shoot extension and finally quantifies proportions of flowers, fruits and vegetative growth in two consecutive peak flowering periods. We show that Calluna life-cycle phases can be spatially differentiated in pioneer, building and mature phases in UAV imagery. In the juvenile phase, regeneration from germination is low (<10%) and sprouting from the stem base dominates recovery patterns after fire management. The study further reveals that the distribution of flowering and fruiting during peak flowering time is spatially heterogeneous with high variations between years. In the fire unaffected mature phase, proportions of flowers and fruits are reduced indicating a decrease in reproductive capacity of unmanaged Calluna stands. A phenological phase shift is detected from flowering to fruiting that is related to an increase of Calluna growth height. The study shows that the functional patterns of growth and reproduction can be mapped for heathland ecosystems using simple true color drone cameras.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Neumann","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Behling","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Schindhelm","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Itzerott","given":"Sibylle"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Wichmann","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jörg"}],"citation-key":"NeumannEtAl_2020","container-title":"Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation","DOI":"10.1002/rse2.121","ISSN":"2056-3485","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rse2.121","page":"35-51","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The colors of heath flowering – quantifying spatial patterns of phenology in Calluna life-cycle phases using high-resolution drone imagery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rse2.121","volume":"6"},

The capacity to use these cameras to produce time series information contributes to a better understanding of relationships between environmental conditions, vegetation health, and productivity. In this study we evaluate the use of consumer grade digital cameras modified to capture infrared wavelengths for monitoring vegetation. The use of infrared imagery is very common in satellite remote sensing, while most current near sensing studies are limited to visible wavelengths only. The use of infrared-visible observations is theoretically superior over the use of just visible observation due to the strong contrast between infrared and visible reflection of vegetation, the high correlation of the three visible bands and the possibilities to use spectral indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. This paper presents two experiments: the first study compares infrared modified and true color cameras to detect seasonal development of understory plants species in a forest; the second is aimed at evaluation of spectrometer and camera data collected during a laboratory plant stress experiment. The main goal of the experiments is to evaluate the utility of infrared modified cameras for the monitoring of plant health and phenology. Results show that infrared converted cameras perform less than standard color cameras in a monitoring setting. Comparison of the infrared camera response to spectrometer data points at limits in dynamic range, and poor band separation as the main weaknesses of converted consumer cameras.

  {"id":"NortonEtAl_2019","abstract":"There are increasing calls to provide greenspace in urban areas, yet the ecological quality, as well as quantity, of greenspace is important. Short mown grassland designed for recreational use is the dominant form of urban greenspace in temperate regions but requires considerable maintenance and typically provides limited habitat value for most taxa. Alternatives are increasingly proposed, but the biodiversity potential of these is not well understood. In a replicated experiment across six public urban greenspaces, we used nine different perennial meadow plantings to quantify the relative roles of floristic diversity and height of sown meadows on the richness and composition of three taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, and soil microbes. We found that all meadow treatments were colonized by plant species not sown in the plots, suggesting that establishing sown meadows does not preclude further locally determined grassland development if management is appropriate. Colonizing species were rarer in taller and more diverse plots, indicating competition may limit invasion rates. Urban meadow treatments contained invertebrate and microbial communities that differed from mown grassland. Invertebrate taxa responded to changes in both height and richness of meadow vegetation, but most orders were more abundant where vegetation height was longer than mown grassland. Order richness also increased in longer vegetation and Coleoptera family richness increased with plant diversity in summer. Microbial community composition seems sensitive to plant species composition at the soil surface (0–10 cm), but in deeper soils (11–20 cm) community variation was most responsive to plant height, with bacteria and fungi responding differently. In addition to improving local residents’ site satisfaction, native perennial meadow plantings can produce biologically diverse grasslands that support richer and more abundant invertebrate communities, and restructured plant, invertebrate, and soil microbial communities compared with short mown grassland. Our results suggest that diversification of urban greenspace by planting urban meadows in place of some mown amenity grassland is likely to generate substantial biodiversity benefits, with a mosaic of meadow types likely to maximize such benefits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Norton","given":"Briony A."},{"family":"Bending","given":"Gary D."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Corstanje","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Dunnett","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Karl L."},{"family":"Grafius","given":"Darren R."},{"family":"Gravestock","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Grice","given":"Samuel M."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Jim A."},{"family":"Hilton","given":"Sally"},{"family":"Hoyle","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Mercer","given":"Theresa G."},{"family":"Pawlett","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Pescott","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Richards","given":"J.

  {"id":"Nybom_2004","abstract":"A compilation was made of 307 studies using nuclear DNA markers for evaluating among- and within-population diversity in wild angiosperms and gymnosperms. Estimates derived by the dominantly inherited markers (RAPD, AFLP, ISSR) are very similar and may be directly comparable. STMS analysis yields almost three times higher values for within-population diversity whereas among-population diversity estimates are similar to those derived by the dominantly inherited markers. Number of sampled plants per population and number of scored microsatellite DNA alleles are correlated with some of the population genetics parameters. In addition, maximum geographical distance between sampled populations has a strong positive effect on among-population diversity. As previously verified with allozyme data, RAPD- and STMS-based analyses show that long-lived, outcrossing, late successional taxa retain most of their genetic variability within populations. By contrast, annual, selfing and/or early successional taxa allocate most of the genetic variability among populations. Estimates for among- and within-population diversity, respectively, were negatively correlated. The only major discrepancy between allozymes and STMS on the one hand, and RAPD on the other hand, concerns geographical range; within-population diversity was strongly affected when the former methods were used but not so in the RAPD-based studies. Direct comparisons between the different methods, when applied to the same plant material, indicate large similarities between the dominant markers and somewhat lower similarity with the STMS-based data, presumably due to insufficient number of analysed microsatellite DNA loci in many studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nybom","given":"Hilde"}],"citation-key":"Nybom_2004","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02141.x","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02141.x","page":"1143-1155","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Comparison of different nuclear DNA markers for estimating intraspecific genetic diversity in plants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02141.x","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"OLearyEtAl_2018","abstract":"Sequencing reduced-representation libraries of restriction site-associated DNA (RADseq) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is quickly becoming a standard methodology for molecular ecologists. Because of the scale of RADseq data sets, putative loci cannot be assessed individually, making the process of filtering noise and correctly identifying biologically meaningful signal more difficult. Artefacts introduced during library preparation and/or bioinformatic processing of SNP data can create patterns that are incorrectly interpreted as indicative of population structure or natural selection. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider types of errors that may be introduced during laboratory work and data processing, and how to minimize, detect and remove these errors. Here, we discuss issues inherent to RADseq methodologies that can result in artefacts during library preparation and locus reconstruction resulting in erroneous SNP calls and, ultimately, genotyping error. Further, we describe steps that can be implemented to create a rigorously filtered data set consisting of markers accurately representing independent loci and compare the effect of different combinations of filters on four RAD data sets. At last, we stress the importance of publishing raw sequence data along with final filtered data sets in addition to detailed documentation of filtering steps and quality control measures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Leary","given":"Shannon J."},{"family":"Puritz","given":"Jonathan B."},{"family":"Willis","given":"Stuart C."},{"family":"Hollenbeck","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"Portnoy","given":"David S."}],"citation-key":"OLearyEtAl_2018","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.14792","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.14792","page":"3193-3206","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"These aren’t the loci you’e looking for: Principles of effective SNP filtering for molecular ecologists","title-short":"These aren’t the loci you’e looking for","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.14792","volume":"27"},

Using three empirical RAD-seq datasets, we demonstrate a method for optimising a de novo assembly of loci using stacks. By iterating values of the program's main parameters and plotting resultant core metrics for visualisation, researchers can gain a much better understanding of their dataset and select an optimal set of parameters; we present the 80% rule as a generally effective method to select the core parameters for stacks. Visualisation of the metrics plotted for the three RAD-seq datasets shows that they differ in the optimal parameters that should be used to maximise the amount of available biological information. We also demonstrate that building loci de novo and then integrating alignment positions is more effective than aligning raw reads directly to a reference genome.

Ecogeographical land characterization (ELC) maps constitute a new tool in this direction with great potential. To assess the usefulness of this approach, an ELC map of Spain was created through multivariate methods. Its performance to characterize plant habitat preferences was compared with existing ecological regions and land cover maps. Collecting sites and seed weight from eight plant species were used to test the ELC map. Categories from each map were assigned to accessions using collecting sites. Chi-square tests were applied to test if category frequency distributions for each species followed a distribution proportional to the relative frequency of categories in each map. The tests found significant differences in the eight species studied. Thus, Bonferroni confidence intervals (BCI) classified categories from maps in preferred, neutral or avoided habitats. Seed weight was used as a proxy for plant adaptation. Comparison between observed and expected ranking of BCI and quartile classes in terms of seed weight means, and GLM and post-hoc tests carried out to test the effect of these classes upon seed weight showed consistently better results for the ELC map.

This method includes the application of geographic information systems, ecogeographical land characterization maps, species distribution models and gap analysis to identify prioritized collecting sites. To evaluate the efficiency of this collecting method, field collecting expeditions were carried out focusing on prioritized sites and the results of these collections were analyzed. Prioritized sites were identified using spatial and ecogeographical gaps, and potential species richness maps. The spatial gaps corresponded to populations non-included in the collection but recorded by other information sources while ecogeographical gaps corresponded to spatial gaps that were located in ecogeographical categories (obtained from the ecogeographical map) that were scarcely represented in the collection. A potential Lupinus species richness map was obtained by adding the information of single maps of Lupinus species distribution models. Subsequently, prioritized sites were obtained in ecogeographical gaps with high potential species richness values. Collecting expeditions were made in Spain in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Results showed that using the efficient germplasm collecting methodology was highly positive not only from a quantitative viewpoint (between 7.8 and 11% increase) but also in qualitative terms, focusing collection efforts in ecogeographical categories with low or null representation in the Spanish Lupinus collection (41% of the new accessions).

  {"id":"PearsonEtAl_2007","abstract":"Aim Techniques that predict species potential distributions by combining observed occurrence records with environmental variables show much potential for application across a range of biogeographical analyses. Some of the most promising applications relate to species for which occurrence records are scarce, due to cryptic habits, locally restricted distributions or low sampling effort. However, the minimum sample sizes required to yield useful predictions remain difficult to determine. Here we developed and tested a novel jackknife validation approach to assess the ability to predict species occurrence when fewer than 25 occurrence records are available. Location Madagascar. Methods Models were developed and evaluated for 13 species of secretive leaf-tailed geckos (Uroplatus spp.) that are endemic to Madagascar, for which available sample sizes range from 4 to 23 occurrence localities (at 1 km2 grid resolution). Predictions were based on 20 environmental data layers and were generated using two modelling approaches: a method based on the principle of maximum entropy (Maxent) and a genetic algorithm (GARP). Results We found high success rates and statistical significance in jackknife tests with sample sizes as low as five when the Maxent model was applied. Results for GARP at very low sample sizes (less than c. 10) were less good. When sample sizes were experimentally reduced for those species with the most records, variability among predictions using different combinations of localities demonstrated that models were greatly influenced by exactly which observations were included. Main conclusions We emphasize that models developed using this approach with small sample sizes should be interpreted as identifying regions that have similar environmental conditions to where the species is known to occur, and not as predicting actual limits to the range of a species. The jackknife validation approach proposed here enables assessment of the predictive ability of models built using very small sample sizes, although use of this test with larger sample sizes may lead to overoptimistic estimates of predictive power. Our analyses demonstrate that geographical predictions developed from small numbers of occurrence records may be of great value, for example in targeting field surveys to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations and species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearson","given":"Richard G."},{"family":"Raxworthy","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"A.

Methods Flower buds and flowers were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy. Key Results The pistillode, stamens, and sepals form a floral apparatus that explosively releases pollen to be carried by the wind. The anthers dehisce when the stamens are still inflexed on the floral bud and are enveloped by the sepals and supported by an inflated pistillode. The distension of the filaments presses the pistillode, which decreases the pressure exerted on the anthers by releasing the air accumulated internally through its apical orifice. The extended filaments and the dehiscent free anthers move rapidly outward from the center of the flower. This movement of the filaments is then blocked by the robust basally united sepals, which causes a rapid inversion of the anther position, thus hurling the pollen grains far from the flower. The pollen grains are released grouped by the mucilage produced in high quantity in the cells found in all floral organs. Conclusions The anatomical structure of the pistillode and the finding of mucilaginous cells are the main features that help in the understanding the explosive mechanism of pollen release in urticalean rosids. The pistillode can be considered an exaptation because it was evolved later to provide a new role in the plant, optimizing male fitness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Pedersoli","given":"Giseli D."},{"family":"Leme","given":"Flávia M."},{"family":"Leite","given":"Viviane G."},{"family":"Teixeira","given":"Simone P."}],"citation-key":"PedersoliEtAl_2019","container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.1002/ajb2.1254","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajb2.1254","page":"489-506","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Anatomy solves the puzzle of explosive pollen release in wind-pollinated urticalean rosids","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajb2.1254","volume":"106"},

However, with ongoing climate change, invasive species may rapidly move upwards and threaten mid-, and then high-elevation mountain ecosystems. We evaluated this threat by modeling the current and future habitat suitability for 48 invasive plant species in Switzerland and New South Wales, Australia. Both regions had contrasting climate interactions with elevation, resulting in possible different responses of species distributions to climate change. Using a species distribution modeling approach that combines data from two spatial scales, we built high-resolution species distribution models (≤250 m) that account for the global climatic niche of species and also finer variables depicting local climate and disturbances. We found that different environmental drivers limit the elevation range of invasive species in each of the two regions, leading to region-specific species responses to climate change. The optimal suitability for plant invaders is predicted to markedly shift from the lowland to the montane or subalpine zone in Switzerland, whereas the upward shift is far less pronounced in New South Wales where montane and subalpine elevations are already suitable. The results suggest that species most likely to invade high elevations in Switzerland will be cold-tolerant, whereas species with an affinity to moist soils are most likely to invade higher elevations in Australia. Other plant traits were only marginally associated with elevation limits. These results demonstrate that a more systematic consideration of future distributions of invasive species is required in conservation plans of not yet invaded mountainous ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Petitpierre","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"McDougall","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Seipel","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Broennimann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Kueffer","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"PetitpierreEtAl_2016","container-title":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1890/14-1871","ISSN":"1939-5582","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/14-1871","page":"530-544","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Will climate change increase the risk of plant invasions into mountains?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/14-1871","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"PetitpierreEtAl_2017","abstract":"Aim Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to predict impacts of global change on biodiversity, but the reliability of these predictions in space and time depends on their transferability. We tested how the strategy used to choose predictors impacts the transferability of SDMs at a cross-continental scale. Location North America, Eurasia and Australia. Method We used a systematic approach including 50 Holarctic plant invaders and 27 initial predictor variables, considering 10 different strategies for variable selection, accounting for the proximality, multicollinearity and climate analogy of predictors. We compared the average performance of each strategy, some of which used a large number of predictor combinations. Next, we looked for the single best model for each species across all the predictor combinations retained in the analysis. Transferability was considered as the predictive success of SDMs calibrated in the native range and projected onto the invaded range. Results Two strategies showed better SDM transferability on average: a set of predictors known for their ecologically meaningful effects on plant distribution, and the two first axes of a principal component analysis calibrated on all predictor variables (Spc2). From the more than 2000 combinations of predictors per species across strategies, the best set of predictors yielded SDMs with good transferability for 45 species (90%). These best combinations consisted of eight randomly assembled (39 species) or uncorrelated predictors (6 species) and Spc2 (5 species). We also found that internal cross-validation was not sufficient to give full information about the transferability of a SDM to a distinct range. Main conclusion Transferring SDMs at the macroclimatic scale, and thus anticipating invasions, is possible for the large majority of invasive plants considered in this study, but the accuracy of the predictions relies strongly on the choice of predictors. From our results, we recommend including either proximal and state-of-the-art variables or a reduced and orthogonalized set to obtain robust SDM projections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Petitpierre","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"Broennimann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Kueffer","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Daehler","given":"Curtis"},{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"}],"citation-key":"PetitpierreEtAl_2017","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/geb.12530","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.12530","page":"275-287","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Selecting predictors to maximize the transferability of species distribution models: lessons from cross-continental plant invasions","title-short":"Selecting predictors to maximize the transferability of species distribution models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12530","volume":"26"},

Their predictive performance can be characterized in two complementary ways: discrimination, the ability to distinguish between occupied and unoccupied sites, and calibration, the extent to which a model correctly predicts conditional probability of presence. The most common measures of model performance, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), measure only discrimination. In contrast, we introduce a new tool for measuring model calibration: the presence-only calibration plot, or POC plot. This tool relies on presence-only evaluation data, which are more widely available than presence–absence evaluation data, to determine whether predictions are proportional to conditional probability of presence. We generalize the predicted/expected curves of Hirzel et al. to produce a presence-only analogue of traditional (presence–absence) calibration curves. POC plots facilitate visual exploration of model calibration, and can be used to recalibrate badly calibrated models. We demonstrate their use by recalibrating models made by the DOMAIN modeling method on a comprehensive set of 226 species from six regions of the world, significantly improving DOMAIN's predictive performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Elith","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"PhillipsElith_2010","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1890/09-0760.1","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/09-0760.1","page":"2476-2484","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"POC plots: calibrating species distribution models with presence-only data","title-short":"POC plots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/09-0760.1","volume":"91"},

It contains small functional changes, most notably use of a complementary log-log (cloglog) transform to produce an estimate of occurrence probability. The cloglog transform derives from the recently-published interpretation of Maxent as an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP), giving it a stronger theoretical justification than the logistic transform which it replaces by default. In addition, the new R package, maxnet, fits Maxent models using the glmnet package for regularized generalized linear models. We discuss the implications of the IPP formulation in terms of model inputs and outputs, treating occurrence records as points rather than grid cells and interpreting the exponential Maxent model (raw output) as as an estimate of relative abundance.

  {"id":"PirononEtAl_2017","abstract":"The ‘centre–periphery hypothesis’ (CPH) is a long-standing postulate in ecology that states that genetic variation and demographic performance of a species decrease from the centre to the edge of its geographic range. This hypothesis is based on an assumed concordance between geographical peripherality and ecological marginality such that environmental conditions become harsher towards the limits of a species range. In this way, the CPH sets the stage for understanding the causes of distribution limits. To date, no study has examined conjointly the consistency of these postulates. In an extensive literature review we discuss the birth and development of the CPH and provide an assessment of the CPH by reviewing 248 empirical studies in the context of three main themes. First, a decrease in species occurrence towards their range limits was observed in 81% of studies, while only 51% demonstrated reduced abundance of individuals. A decline in genetic variation, increased differentiation among populations and higher rates of inbreeding were demonstrated by roughly one in two studies (47, 45 and 48%, respectively). However, demographic rates, size and population performance less often followed CPH expectations (20–30% of studies). We highlight the impact of important methodological, taxonomic, and biogeographical biases on such validation rates. Second, we found that geographic and ecological marginality gradients are not systematically concordant, which casts doubt on the reliability of a main assumption of the CPH. Finally, we attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of geographical, ecological and historical processes on the spatial distribution of genetic and demographic parameters. While ecological marginality gradients explain variation in species' demographic performance better than geographic gradients, contemporary and historical factors may contribute interactively to spatial patterns of genetic variation. We thereby propose a framework that integrates species' ecological niche characteristics together with current and past range structure to investigate spatial patterns of genetic and demographic variation across species ranges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Pironon","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Papuga","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Villellas","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"Angert","given":"Amy L."},{"family":"García","given":"María B."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"John D."}],"citation-key":"PirononEtAl_2017","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12313","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12313","page":"1877-1909","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Geographic variation in genetic and demographic performance: new insights from an old biogeographical paradigm","title-short":"Geographic variation in genetic and demographic performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12313","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"PollockEtAl_2014","abstract":"A primary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Two major strands of ecology – habitat modelling and community ecology – approach this problem differently. Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species’ and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these distinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence. We provide a general description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were not fully described by the environmental variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assemblages despite having similar environmental affinities. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a major limitation of modelling species distributions independently.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Pollock","given":"Laura J."},{"family":"Tingley","given":"Reid"},{"family":"Morris","given":"William K."},{"family":"Golding","given":"Nick"},{"family":"O'Hara","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Parris","given":"Kirsten M."},{"family":"Vesk","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Michael A."}],"citation-key":"PollockEtAl_2014","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12180","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12180","page":"397-406","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Understanding co-occurrence by modelling species simultaneously with a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12180","volume":"5"},

Here, we ask how both the distribution and phenology of three food-producing shrubs native to northwestern North America might shift as the climate changes. To address this question, we compared gridded climate data with species location data to identify climate variables that best predicted the current bioclimatic niches of beaked hazelnut (Corylus cornuta), Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium), and salal (Gaultheria shallon). We also developed thermal-sum models for the timing of flowering and fruit ripening for these species. We then used multi-model ensemble future climate projections to estimate how species range and phenology may change under future conditions. Modelling efforts showed extreme minimum temperature, climate moisture deficit, and mean summer precipitation were predictive of climatic suitability across all three species. Future bioclimatic niche models project substantial reductions in habitat suitability across the lower elevation and southern portions of the species’ current ranges by the end of the 21st century. Thermal-sum phenology models for these species indicate that flowering and the ripening of fruits and nuts will advance an average of 25 days by the mid-21st century, and 36 days by the late-21st century under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5).

Here we address three critical ones: selecting appropriate evaluation data, detecting overfitting, and tuning program settings to approximate optimal model complexity. We integrate solutions to these issues for Maxent models, using the Caribbean spiny pocket mouse, Heteromys anomalus, as an example. Location North-western South America. Methods We partitioned data into calibration and evaluation datasets via three variations of k-fold cross-validation: randomly partitioned, geographically structured and masked geographically structured (which restricts background data to regions corresponding to calibration localities). Then, we carried out tuning experiments by varying the level of regularization, which controls model complexity. Finally, we gauged performance by quantifying discriminatory ability and overfitting, as well as via visual inspections of maps of the predictions in geography. Results Performance varied among data-partitioning approaches and among regularization multipliers. The randomly partitioned approach inflated estimates of model performance and the geographically structured approach showed high overfitting. In contrast, the masked geographically structured approach allowed selection of high-performing models based on all criteria. Discriminatory ability showed a slight peak in performance around the default regularization multiplier. However, regularization levels two to four times higher than the default yielded substantially lower overfitting. Visual inspection of maps of model predictions coincided with the quantitative evaluations. Main conclusions Species-specific tuning of model parameters can improve the performance of Maxent models. Further, accurate estimates of model performance and overfitting depend on using independent evaluation data.

Here we integrate genomic and ecological modeling approaches to identify genetic adaptations associated with climate in two cryptic forest bats. We then incorporate this information directly into forecasts of range changes under future climate change and assessment of population persistence through the spread of climate-adaptive genetic variation (evolutionary rescue potential). Considering climate-adaptive potential reduced range loss projections, suggesting that failure to account for intraspecific variability can result in overestimation of future losses. On the other hand, range overlap between species was projected to increase, indicating that interspecific competition is likely to play an important role in limiting species’ future ranges. We show that although evolutionary rescue is possible, it depends on a population’s adaptive capacity and connectivity. Hence, we stress the importance of incorporating genomic data and landscape connectivity in climate change vulnerability assessments and conservation management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Razgour","given":"Orly"},{"family":"Forester","given":"Brenna"},{"family":"Taggart","given":"John B."},{"family":"Bekaert","given":"Michaël"},{"family":"Juste","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Ibáñez","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Puechmaille","given":"Sébastien J."},{"family":"Novella-Fernandez","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Alberdi","given":"Antton"},{"family":"Manel","given":"Stéphanie"}],"citation-key":"RazgourEtAl_2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1820663116","ISBN":"9781820663118","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"language":"en","page":"10418-10423","PMID":"31061126","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Considering adaptive genetic variation in climate change vulnerability assessment reduces species range loss projections","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10418","volume":"116"},

Here, we describe the first software natively capable of using paired-end sequencing to derive short contigs from de novo RAD data. Stacks version 2 employs a de Bruijn graph assembler to build and connect contigs from forward and reverse reads for each de novo RAD locus, which it then uses as a reference for read alignments. The new architecture allows all the individuals in a metapopulation to be considered at the same time as each RAD locus is processed. This enables a Bayesian genotype caller to provide precise SNPs, and a robust algorithm to phase those SNPs into long haplotypes, generating RAD loci that are 400–800 bp in length. To prove its recall and precision, we tested the software with simulated data and compared reference-aligned and de novo analyses of three empirical data sets. Our study shows that the latest version of Stacks is highly accurate and outperforms other software in assembling and genotyping paired-end de novo data sets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rochette","given":"Nicolas C."},{"family":"Rivera‐Colón","given":"Angel G."},{"family":"Catchen","given":"Julian M."}],"citation-key":"RochetteEtAl_2019","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15253","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.15253","page":"4737-4754","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Stacks 2: Analytical methods for paired-end sequencing improve RADseq-based population genomics","title-short":"Stacks 2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.15253","volume":"28"},

We observed high levels of heterozygosity for both species across populations with private alleles ranging from 0 to 26. For V. macrocarpon, we found a total of 613 alleles and high levels of heterozygosity (HO = 0.99, HT = 0.75). We also observed high numbers of alleles (881) and levels of heterozygosity (HO = 0.71, HT = 0.80) in V. oxycoccos (4x). Our genetic analyses confirmed the field identification of a native population of V. macrocarpon on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in the state of Washington, far outside the previously reported range for the species.

  {"id":"Rodriguez-ReyEtAl_2013","abstract":"The evaluation of species distribution models (SDMs) is a crucial step; usually, a random subsample of data is used to test prediction capacity. This procedure, called cross-validation, has been recently shown to overestimate SDMs performance due to spatial autocorrelation. In the case of expanding species, there exists the possibility to test the predictions with non-random geographically structured data, i.e., a new data set which corresponds to the last occupied localities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of SDMs to predict the range expansion pattern of six free-living deer species in Great Britain and to assess whether SDMs perform better than a simple dispersal model – a null model that assumes no environmental control in the expansion process. Distribution data for the species prior to 1972 were used to train the SDMs (ENFA, MAXENT, logistic regression and an ensemble model) in order to obtain suitability maps. Additionally, the geographical distance to the localities occupied in 1972 was considered a proxy of the probability that a certain locality has to be occupied during an expansion process considering only dispersal (GD model). Subsequently, we analysed whether the species increased their ranges between 1972 and 2006 according to the estimated suitability patterns and whether or not SDMs predictions outperformed GD predictions. SDMs showed a high discrimination capacity in the training data, with the ensemble models performing the best and ENFA models the worst. SDMs predictions also worked better than chance in classifying new occupied localities, although differences among techniques disappeared and the predictions showed no difference with respect to GD. Spatial autocorrelation of both the environmental predictors and the expansion process may explain these results which illustrate that GD is a much more parsimonious model than any of the SDMs and may thus be preferable both for prediction and explanation. Overestimation of SDMs performance and usefulness may be a common fact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodríguez-Rey","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Jiménez-Valverde","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Acevedo","given":"Pelayo"}],"citation-key":"Rodriguez-ReyEtAl_2013","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.01.024","ISSN":"0304-3800","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1-5","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Species distribution models predict range expansion better than chance but not better than a simple dispersal model","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380013000914","volume":"256"},

Fortunately, tools for identifying and accommodating potentially confounding spatial or temporal trends are available, and new methods are being rapidly developed.

Although species endemic to islands or archipelagos have high conservation value and are vulnerable to human impacts2,3, there has been no global analysis of climate-driven extinction risk focused on island endemics. Here, we use conifers as a model system to assess extinction risk among island endemics under climate projections for 2070. We employ the emerging technique of combining native and non-native occurrence data to model climatic conditions under which each species can sustain a population4–7 and also incorporate horticultural data to model the broader range of conditions that allow short-term survival. Our projections indicate that some species will retain suitable climatic conditions, some will experience conditions completely precluding survival and others will experience intermediate-risk conditions that lead to population decline and eventual extinction. Based on different climate change models, we report island size thresholds of 400 to 20,000 km2, below which extinction risks increase. These patterns are driven by correlations among island area and the breadth of species’ realized, fundamental and tolerance niches. Notably, realized and fundamental niche breadth are positively correlated.

  {"id":"RoubicekEtAl_2010","abstract":"Ecological niche models (ENMs) have multiple applications in ecology, evolution and conservation planning. They relate the known locations of a species to characteristics of its environment (usually climate) over its geographical range. Most ENMs are trained using standard 30-year (1961–1990) or 50-year (1951–2000) baselines to represent current climate conditions. Species occurrence records used as input to the models, however, are frequently collected from time periods that differ from those from which the climate is derived. Since climate variability can be significant within and outside baselines, and the distributions of some plants and animals (e.g., annual plants, insects) can adjust to environmental conditions on much shorter time scales, this mismatch between collection records and climatic baselines may affect the utility and accuracy of model outputs. We investigated how the choice of baseline periods influenced modelling efforts, anticipating that climate baselines derived from the same temporal period as the species records would yield improved ENMs. Ten simulated species’ distributions were modelled using an ENM (Maxent) for (a) occurrences and climates within the same temporal period, based on eighteen 10-year baselines within the 20th century and (b) all available samples and climate baselines from 1951–2000 and 1961–1990. Each model was projected onto all the available 10-year climate scenarios and compared to the models trained on the corresponding scenario. We show that temporal mismatches of species occurrences and climate baselines can result in significantly poorer distribution models. Such temporal mismatch may be unavoidable for many studies, but we emphasize here the need to match the time range of samples and climate data whenever possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Roubicek","given":"A.

Peripheral areas are characterized by variable and unstable conditions, relative to core areas. Peripheral populations are expected to be genetically more variable, since the variable conditions induce fluctuating selection, which maintains high genetic diversity. Alternatively, due to marginal ecological conditions at the periphery, populations there are small and isolated; the within-population diversity is low, but the between-population genetic diversity is high due to genetic drift. It is also likely that peripheral populations evolve resistance to extreme conditions. Thus, peripheral populations rather than core ones may be resistant to environmental extremes and changes, such as global climate change induced by the anthropogenically emitted “greenhouse gases”. They should be treated as a biogenetic resource used for rehabilitation and restoration of damaged ecosystems. Climatic transition zones are characterized by a high incidence of species represented by peripheral populations, and therefore should be conserved now as repositories of these resources, to be used in the future for mitigating undesirable effects of global climate change.

The remaining studies relied on data from a small number of points in their analysis, meaning that the range edges were severely under-sampled. Patterns of abundance across the entire range must be known to draw testable hypotheses about the consequences of species’ geographical abundance distributions. Indirect tests of the abundant centre hypothesis, in which ecological or evolutionary expectations of abundant centre distributions were examined, did not support or reject the abundant centre hypothesis overall. We conclude that more exploration of species’ abundance distributions is necessary and we suggest methods to use in future studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Sagarin","given":"Raphael D."},{"family":"Gaines","given":"Steven D."}],"citation-key":"SagarinGaines_2002","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00297.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00297.x","page":"137-147","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The ‘abundant centre’ distribution: to what extent is it a biogeographical rule?","title-short":"The ‘abundant centre’ distribution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00297.x","volume":"5"},

Natural habitats have consequently decreased and became increasingly fragmented, putting high pressure on the wild relatives of main crops. In this study, we assessed the diversity of wild relatives and cultivated varieties of yam, Dioscorea rotundata, a tuber crop grown in West Africa. Using nuclear markers, we showed that 19% of the wild plants were in fact hybrids between wild and cultivated varieties. Using whole chloroplast sequences, our results suggest that hybridization may be even stronger, with 43% of the wild individuals presenting either chloroplast or nuclear introgression with the cultivated yams. Adaptation of agriculture to current new pathogen outbreaks and ongoing climatic changes will require mining the vast diversity found in crops wild relatives. However, our study suggests that wild yam diversity is already largely tainted by crop-to-wild gene flow. The need to focus on in-situ wild yam conservation is even more crucial, since today, ex-situ genebanks contain nearly no wild yam accessions.\nData profile\nMicrosatellite allele scoring is available as an online appendix; NGS data (.bam file) are available as SRA bioproject PRJNA383673.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Scarcelli","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Chaïr","given":"Hâna"},{"family":"Causse","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Vesta","given":"Raphaël"},{"family":"Couvreur","given":"Thomas L.

Nei's gene diversity statistics (HT=0.043, HS=0.019, GST=0.551) indicated low levels of variation but relatively highly differentiated populations, suggesting little gene flow. Significant deviations from genotypic expectations under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, high positive fixation indices, and the existence of small genetic neighborhoods within populations suggest that at least some inbreeding occurs. Cluster analysis of Nei's genetic identity statistics and principal component analysis of allele frequency data showed high similarity among the six southern populations with the two northern populations more differentiated from them and from each other.

  {"id":"Schoener_1968","abstract":"The tiny island of South Bimini contains 4 species of lizards of he genus Anolis, a number surpassed only on the 4 largest islands of the Greater Antilles and on 2 very large and nearby satellite islands. These species are syntopic with respect to a two—dimensional area of the ground but divide the habitat according to perch height and perch diameter: sagrei is partly terrestrial but occurs more often on small and large low perches; distichus prefers the trunks and large branches of medium to large trees; angusticipes inhabits small twigs, especially at great heights; and carolinensis is found mostly on leaves or on the adjacent twigs and brances. The size classes of the species are staggered in such a way that the interspecific classes which overlap most in habitat overlap least in prey size. Similarities in prey size and prey taxa for classes of the same species are somewhat greater than those expected on the basis of habitat and morphology alone. The distribution of the species among the vegetation communities of Bimini can be explained on the basis of perch height and diameter preference. Within the same species, the larger lizards usually eat larger food, fewer items, and in sagrei more fruit; and they have a greater average range of food size per digestive tract. One species (distichus) is extremely myrmecophagous: about 75—90% of its food items are ants. In 3 of the 4 species, subadult males take more food and average smaller prey then females of the same head length. That species (distichus) which takes the smallest food items and whose classes overlap the most in habitat preference with those of other species is least dimorphic is size between the sexes. It is suggested that such small, nondimorphic species are best suited for insinuation into complex faunas, whereas larger, dimorphic forms are best for the colonization of empty areas. The usefulness of various measures of overlap and specialization is evaluated for this lizard association.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Schoener","given":"Thomas W."}],"citation-key":"Schoener_1968","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/1935534","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1968]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/1935534","page":"704-726","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Anolis Lizards of Bimini: Resource Partitioning in a Complex Fauna","title-short":"The Anolis Lizards of Bimini","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1935534","volume":"49"},

We applied three emerging techniques for recreating past population dynamics—high resolution aerial photography time series, stem growth ring analysis and population level field surveys—to recreate the introduction and invasion history for bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata) in Western Australia. We also compared across dating techniques to test the validity of using stem rings produced by successive cambia for dating purposes, and analysed for the influence of ontogenetic, environmental and morphological factors on stem ring formation. Aerial photography allowed for an accurate recreation of plant presence over time and individual plant age for 18 plants. In a sample of over 500 plants with up to 42 rings, canopy area was related to plant age and ring number, while stem diameter was related to canopy size and ring number. However, stem rings were not produced in a temporally consistent manner and could not be predicted reliably. Up to eight stem rings were produced in younger plants, for which the rate of ring production was greatest. While there was an ontogenetic growth pattern for ring width, no inter-plant synchronisation of ring size was detected, as would be expected if ring size were a response to landscape level climate factors. With aerial imagery and stem ring analysis providing new ways to recreate plant population dynamics at the individual plant level, managers can use this insight to refine conservation and invasion management programs. For bitou bush, such information will focus the duration and location of the current eradication program in Western Australia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"John K."},{"family":"Batchelor","given":"Kathryn L."},{"family":"Jucker","given":"Tommaso"},{"family":"Webber","given":"Bruce L."}],"citation-key":"ScottEtAl_2019","container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-019-02026-5","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2983-2996","source":"Springer Link","title":"Aerial photography and dendrochronology as tools for recreating invasion histories: do they work for bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata)?","title-short":"Aerial photography and dendrochronology as tools for recreating invasion histories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-02026-5","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"SextonEtAl_2014","abstract":"Gene flow among populations can enhance local adaptation if it introduces new genetic variants available for selection, but strong gene flow can also stall adaptation by swamping locally beneficial genes. These outcomes can depend on population size, genetic variation, and the environmental context. Gene flow patterns may align with geographic distance (IBD—isolation by distance), whereby immigration rates are inversely proportional to the distance between populations. Alternatively gene flow may follow patterns of isolation by environment (IBE), whereby gene flow rates are higher among similar environments. Finally, gene flow may be highest among dissimilar environments (counter-gradient gene flow), the classic “gene-swamping” scenario. Here we survey relevant studies to determine the prevalence of each pattern across environmental gradients. Of 70 studies, we found evidence of IBD in 20.0%, IBE in 37.1%, and both patterns in 37.1%. In addition, 10.0% of studies exhibited counter-gradient gene flow. In total, 74.3% showed significant IBE patterns. This predominant IBE pattern of gene flow may have arisen directly through natural selection or reflect other adaptive and nonadaptive processes leading to nonrandom gene flow. It also precludes gene swamping as a widespread phenomenon.

  {"id":"SextonEtAl_2016","abstract":"Gene flow may influence the formation of species range limits, and yet little is known about the patterns of gene flow with respect to environmental gradients or proximity to range limits. With rapid environmental change, it is especially important to understand patterns of gene flow to inform conservation efforts. Here we investigate the species range of the selfing, annual plant, Mimulus laciniatus, in the California Sierra Nevada. We assessed genetic variation, gene flow, and population abundance across the entire elevation-based climate range. Contrary to expectations, within-population plant density increased towards both climate limits. Mean genetic diversity of edge populations was equivalent to central populations; however, all edge populations exhibited less genetic diversity than neighbouring interior populations. Genetic differentiation was fairly consistent and moderate among all populations, and no directional signals of contemporary gene flow were detected between central and peripheral elevations. Elevation-driven gene flow (isolation by environment), but not isolation by distance, was found across the species range. These findings were the same towards high- and low-elevation range limits and were inconsistent with two common centre-edge hypotheses invoked for the formation of species range limits: (i) decreasing habitat quality and population size; (ii) swamping gene flow from large, central populations. This pattern demonstrates that climate, but not centre-edge dynamics, is an important range-wide factor structuring M. laciniatus populations. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to relate environmental patterns of gene flow to range limits hypotheses. Similar investigations across a wide variety of taxa and life histories are needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sexton","given":"Jason P."},{"family":"Hufford","given":"Matthew B."},{"family":"C.Bateman","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Lowry","given":"David B."},{"family":"Meimberg","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Strauss","given":"Sharon Y."},{"family":"Rice","given":"Kevin J."}],"citation-key":"SextonEtAl_2016","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.13528","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.13528","page":"911-928","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Climate structures genetic variation across a species' elevation range: a test of range limits hypotheses","title-short":"Climate structures genetic variation across a species' elevation range","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13528","volume":"25"},

Grasspea (L. sativus) is the most widely used species and to a lesser extent L. cicera and L. ochrus, each is used for animal feed in many parts of the world and food in poorer regions, but human over-consumption of the seeds can lead to lathyrism, a disease caused by neurotoxins. This study has added substantial information and accuracy to the existing global Lathyrus database by combining diverse datasets and by adding information of major herbaria from Europe. This global Lathyrus database, available at ICARDA, was used to conduct gap analysis to guide future collecting missions and in situ conservation efforts for highest priority species originating from the Mediterranean Basin, and Caucasus, Central and West Asia region. The results showed the highest concentration of Lathyrus priority species are found in the Fertile Crescent countries, France, Italy and Greece. The area either side of the Lebanese/Syrian border near Tel Kalakh, Syria was identified as the hotspot and the overall priority location for establishing the first in situ genetic reserve. The gap analysis for ex situ conservation shows that only six species (representing 16.6 %) of the 36 priority species are adequately sampled. Only L. cicera has already been well sampled among the closely related species to cultivated species L. sativus, indicating further collecting of L. amphicarpos, L. belinensis, L. chrysanthus, L. hirticarpus, L. hirsutus and L. marmoratus is required.

  {"id":"Soberon_2010","abstract":"Statistical modeling of areas of distribution of species by correlative analysis of the environmental features of known presences has become widespread. However, to a large degree, the logic and the functioning of many of these applications remain obscure, not only due to the fact that some of the modeling methods are intrinsically complex (neural networks, genetic algorithms, generalized additive models, for example), but mainly because the role of other ecological processes affecting the species distributions sometimes is not explicitly stated. Resorting to fundamental principles of population ecology, a scheme of analysis based on separation of three factors affecting species distributions (environment, biotic interactions and movements) is used to clarify some results of niche modeling exercises. The area of distribution of a virtual species which was generated by both environmental and biotic factors serves to illustrate the possibility that, at coarse resolutions, the distribution can be approximately recovered using only information about the environmental factors and ignoring the biotic interactions. Finally, information on the distribution of a butterfly species, Baronia brevicornis, is used to illustrate the importance of interpreting the results of niche models by including hypothesis about one class of movements. The results clarify the roles of the three factors in interpreting the results of using correlative approaches to modeling species distributions or their niches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Soberón","given":"Jorge M."}],"citation-key":"Soberon_2010","container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06074.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06074.x","page":"159-167","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Niche and area of distribution modeling: a population ecology perspective","title-short":"Niche and area of distribution modeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06074.x","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"SpalinkEtAl_2019","abstract":"A proactive approach to conservation must be predictive, anticipating how habitats will change and which species are likely to decline or prosper. We use composite species distribution modelling to identify suitable habitats for 18 members of the North American Atlantic Coastal Plain Flora (ACPF) since the Last Glacial Maximum and project these into the future. We then use Scirpus longii (Cyperaceae), a globally imperiled ACPF sedge with many of the characteristics of extinction vulnerability, as a case study. We integrate phylogeographical and population genetic analyses and species distribution modelling to develop a broad view of its current condition and prognosis for conservation. We use genotyping-by-sequencing to characterize the genomes of 142 S. longii individuals from 20 populations distributed throughout its range (New Jersey to Nova Scotia). We measure the distribution of genetic diversity in the species and reconstruct its phylogeographical history using the snapp and rase models. Extant populations of S. longii originated from a single refugium south of the Laurentide ice sheet around 25 ka. The genetic diversity of S. longii is exceedingly low, populations exhibit little genetic structure and the species is slightly inbred. Projected climate scenarios indicate that nearly half of extant populations of S. longii will be exposed to unsuitable climate by 2070. Similar changes in suitable habitat will occur for many other northern ACPF species—centres of diversity will shift northward and Nova Scotia may become the last refuges for those species not extinguished.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Spalink","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"MacKay","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Sytsma","given":"Kenneth J."}],"citation-key":"SpalinkEtAl_2019","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.15006","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.15006","page":"2046-2061","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Phylogeography, population genetics and distribution modelling reveal vulnerability of Scirpus longii (Cyperaceae) and the Atlantic Coastal Plain Flora to climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.15006","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"StiftEtAl_2019","abstract":"Analysis of population genetic structure has become a standard approach in population genetics. In polyploid complexes, clustering analyses can elucidate the origin of polyploid populations and patterns of admixture between different cytotypes. However, combining diploid and polyploid data can theoretically lead to biased inference with (artefactual) clustering by ploidy. We used simulated mixed-ploidy (diploid-autotetraploid) data to systematically compare the performance of k-means clustering and the model-based clustering methods implemented in Structure, Admixture, FastStructure and InStruct under different scenarios of differentiation and with different marker types. Under scenarios of strong population differentiation, the tested applications performed equally well. However, when population differentiation was weak, Structure was the only method that allowed unbiased inference with markers with limited genotypic information (co-dominant markers with unknown dosage or dominant markers). Still, since Structure was comparatively slow, the much faster but less powerful FastStructure provides a reasonable alternative for large datasets. Finally, although bias makes k-means clustering unsuitable for markers with incomplete genotype information, for large numbers of loci (>1000) with known dosage k-means clustering was superior to FastStructure in terms of power and speed. We conclude that Structure is the most robust method for the analysis of genetic structure in mixed-ploidy populations, although alternative methods should be considered under some specific conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Stift","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Kolář","given":"Filip"},{"family":"Meirmans","given":"Patrick G."}],"citation-key":"StiftEtAl_2019","container-title":"Heredity","container-title-short":"Heredity (Edinb)","DOI":"10.1038/s41437-019-0247-6","ISSN":"0018-067X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"page":"429-441","PMCID":"PMC6781132","PMID":"31285566","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Structure is more robust than other clustering methods in simulated mixed-ploidy populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6781132/","volume":"123"},

Urticalean rosids are derived out of a lineage including Barbeyaceae, Dirachmaceae, Elaeagnaceae, and Rhamnaceae, with Rosaceae less closely related; thus, they are imbedded within Rosales. Ulmaceae are the sister to all remaining families. Cannabaceae are derived out of a subclade of Celtidaceae; this expanded family should be called Cannabaceae. Cecropiaceae are derived within Urticaceae and are polyphyletic with Poikilospermum derived elsewhere within Urticaceae; this expanded family should be called Urticaceae. Monophyletic Moraceae are sister to this expanded Urticaceae. Support for these relationships comes from a number of morphological characters (floral sexuality, presence or absence of hypanthium, stamen type and dehiscence, pollen pore number, ovule position, and embryo alignment) and chromosome numbers.

The field of conservation genetics aims at preserving species by using their levels of genetic diversity, usually measured as neutral genome-wide diversity, as a barometer for evaluating population health and extinction risk. A fundamental assumption is that higher levels of genetic diversity lead to an increase in fitness and long-term survival of a species. Here, we argue against the perceived importance of neutral genetic diversity for the conservation of wild populations and species. We demonstrate that no simple general relationship exists between neutral genetic diversity and the risk of species extinction.

  {"id":"TuEtAl_2020","abstract":"In recent times, multi-spectral drone imagery has proved to be a useful tool for measuring tree crop canopy structure. In this context, establishing the most appropriate flight planning variable settings is an essential consideration due to their controls on the quality of the imagery and derived maps of tree and crop biophysical properties. During flight planning, variables including flight altitude, image overlap, flying direction, flying speed and solar elevation, require careful consideration in order to produce the most suitable drone imagery. Previous studies have assessed the influence of individual variables on image quality, but the interaction of multiple variables has yet to be examined. This study assesses the influence of several flight variables on measures of data quality in each processing step, i.e. photo alignment, point cloud densification, 3D model building, and ortho-mosaicking. The analysis produced a drone flight planning and image processing workflow that delivers accurate measurements of tree crops, including the tie point quality, densified point cloud density, and the measurement accuracy of height and plant projective cover derived from individual trees within a commercial avocado orchard. Results showed that flying along the hedgerow, at high solar elevation and with low image pitch angles improved the data quality. Optimal flying speed needs to be set to achieve the required forward overlap. The impacts of each image acquisition variable are discussed in detail and protocols for flight planning optimisation for three scenarios with different drone settings are suggested. Establishing protocols that deliver optimal image acquisitions for the collection of drone data over horticultural tree crops, will create greater confidence in the accuracy of subsequent algorithms and resultant maps of biophysical properties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tu","given":"Yu-Hsuan"},{"family":"Phinn","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Johansen","given":"Kasper"},{"family":"Robson","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"TuEtAl_2020","container-title":"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.12.006","ISSN":"0924-2716","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"83-96","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Optimising drone flight planning for measuring horticultural tree crop structure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271619302941","volume":"160"},

Both climate change and alien plant invasions result from human activities and can cause major environmental and socioeconomic damage. Although they can operate as independent environmental and economic threats, they can also interact. Climate change can facilitate alien plant invasions (1) by altering background environmental conditions; (2) by increasing disturbance through extreme climatic events; and (3) through human responses to climate change. While all plants, regardless of whether they are native or alien, will likely be affected by environmental change, it is widely expected that climate change will favor invasive alien plants at the expense of native plants. The way in which invasive alien plants impact the environment (e.g., modifying hydrology and soil properties, altering fire regimes) can to some extent either contribute to or exacerbate the effect of climate change. Here, we consider why and how climate change is predicted to exacerbate alien plant invasions and provide examples of how invasive alien plants can contribute to climate change. We first briefly describe what makes a plant invasive, how and why a plant becomes invasive, what stages must it go through, and what the drivers of invasion are.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Turbelin","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Catford","given":"Jane A."}],"citation-key":"TurbelinCatford_2021","container-title":"Climate Change (Third Edition)","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-821575-3.00025-6","editor":[{"family":"Letcher","given":"Trevor M."}],"ISBN":"978-0-12-821575-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"515-539","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chapter 25 - Invasive plants and climate change","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128215753000256"},

  {"id":"UeharaEtAl_2021","abstract":"This study attempted to predict the effectiveness of prior informed consent (PIC) as a mechanism under the Nagoya Protocol (NP) through the case of Japan, a developed country with a wealth of genetic biodiversity. The NP to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) aims at creating a virtuous cycle between biodiversity conservation and the utilization of genetic resources through fair and equitable benefit sharing. As PIC is a crucial component of the NP for promoting fair and equitable sharing, this study investigated whether introducing PIC creates a virtuous cycle. Considering the limitations of empirical data, this study adopted a policy Delphi comprising experts in an iterative group communication process that used consecutive questionnaires to reveal diverse issues as input for policymaking. We identified six related issues that were evaluated for the case of introduction and three for the case of no introduction of PIC. Their relative importance as a policy concern was measured through best–worst scaling to narrow down policy-relevant issues. This study revealed that contrary to the NP's intent, the overall contribution to the virtuous cycle is limited. In designing PIC mechanisms, policymakers must pay particular attention to bequest and research and development. This study identified three paths through which the negative impacts on research and development further negatively affect bequest, that is, slackening the identification of important genetic resources and ecosystems to conserve, disincentivizing biodiversity conservation for genetic resource use, and dampening ex-situ conservation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Uehara","given":"Takuro"},{"family":"Sono","given":"Miharu"},{"family":"Tsuge","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Onuma","given":"Ayumi"}],"citation-key":"UeharaEtAl_2021","container-title":"Journal of Environmental Management","container-title-short":"Journal of Environmental Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113767","ISSN":"0301-4797","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,15]]},"language":"en","page":"113767","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Can prior informed consent create virtuous cycle between biodiversity conservation and genetic resources utilization?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479721018296","volume":"300"},

  {"id":"VaclavikMeentemeyer_2012","abstract":"Aim The assumption of equilibrium between organisms and their environment is a standard working postulate in species distribution models (SDMs). However, this assumption is typically violated in models of biological invasions where range expansions are highly constrained by dispersal and colonization processes. Here, we examined how stage of invasion affects the extent to which occurrence data represent the ecological niche of organisms and, in turn, influences spatial prediction of species’ potential distributions. Location Six ecoregions in western Oregon, USA. Methods We compiled occurrence data from 697 field plots collected over a 9-year period (2001–09) of monitoring the spread of invasive forest pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. Using these data, we applied ecological-niche factor analysis to calibrate models of potential distribution across different years of colonization. We accounted for natural variation and uncertainties in model evaluation by further investigating three hypothetical scenarios of varying equilibrium in a simulated virtual species, for which the ‘true’ potential distribution was known. Results We confirm our hypothesis that SDMs calibrated in early stages of invasion are less accurate than models calibrated under scenarios closer to equilibrium. SDMs that are developed in early stages of invasion tend to underpredict the potential range compared to models that are built in later stages of invasion. Main conclusions A full environmental niche of invasive species cannot be effectively captured with data from a realized distribution that is restricted by processes preventing full occupancy of suitable habitats. If SDMs are to be used effectively in conservation and management, stage of invasion needs to be considered to avoid underestimation of habitats at risk of invasion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Václavík","given":"Tomáš"},{"family":"Meentemeyer","given":"Ross K."}],"citation-key":"VaclavikMeentemeyer_2012","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00854.x","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00854.x","page":"73-83","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Equilibrium or not?

Several automated flower cluster quantification methods based on proximal and remote imagery methods have been proposed to estimate flower cluster numbers, but their overall performance is still far from satisfactory. For other methods, the performance of the method to estimate flower clusters within a tree is unknown since they were only tested on images from one perspective. One of the main reported bottlenecks is the presence of occluded flowers due to limitations of the top-view perspective of the platform-sensor combinations. In order to tackle this problem, the multi-view perspective from the Red–Green–Blue (RGB) colored dense point clouds retrieved from drone imagery are compared and evaluated against the field-based flower cluster number per tree. Experimental results obtained on a dataset of two pear tree orchards (N = 144) demonstrate that our 3D object-based method, a combination of pixel-based classification with the stochastic gradient boosting algorithm and density-based clustering (DBSCAN), significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in flower cluster estimations from the 2D top-view (R2 = 0.53), with R2 &gt; 0.7 and RRMSE &lt; 15%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Vanbrabant","given":"Yasmin"},{"family":"Delalieux","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Tits","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Pauly","given":"Klaas"},{"family":"Vandermaesen","given":"Joke"},{"family":"Somers","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"VanbrabantEtAl_2020","container-title":"Agronomy","DOI":"10.3390/agronomy10030407","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3]]},"language":"en","number":"3","page":"407","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Pear Flower Cluster Quantification Using RGB Drone Imagery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/3/407","volume":"10"},

The genetic basis of diplospory was investigated in a triploid (3x = 24) mapping population of 61 individuals that segregated ∼1:1 for diplospory and meiotic reduction. This population was created by crossing a sexual diploid (2x = 16) with a tetraploid diplosporous pollen donor (4x = 32) that was derived from a triploid apomict. Six different inheritance models for diplospory were tested. The segregation ratio and the tight association with specific alleles at the microsatellite loci MSTA53 and MSTA78 strongly suggest that diplospory is controlled by a dominant allele D on a locus, which we have named DIPLOSPOROUS (DIP). Diplosporous plants have a simplex genotype, Ddd or Dddd. MSTA53 and MSTA78 were weakly linked to the 18S-25S rDNA locus. The D-linked allele of MSTA78 was absent in a hypotriploid (2n = 3x – 1) that also lacked one of the satellite chromosomes. Together these results suggest that DIP is located on the satellite chromosome. DIP is female specific, as unreduced gametes are not formed during male meiosis. Furthermore, DIP does not affect parthenogenesis, implying that several independently segregating genes control apomixis in dandelions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Dijk","given":"Peter J","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Bakx-Schotman","given":"J M Tanja"}],"citation-key":"vanDijkBakx-Schotman_2004","container-title":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.166.1.483","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"483-492","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Formation of unreduced megaspores (diplospory) in apomictic dandelions (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, <i>s.l.</i> ) is controlled by a sex-specific dominant locus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/166/1/483/6052845","volume":"166"},

Clear and efficient procedures are needed to access DNA samples, while respecting tropical countries’ and local communities’ rights on genetic resource usage. The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing, which took effect in 2014, provides an opportunity to establish such procedures. However, scientists are concerned that its emphasis on monetary gains restricts research focused on scientific, societal, and environmental benefits. Despite much political and scientific debate, few concrete cases have demonstrated the practical functioning of the Nagoya Protocol. This paper describes the first application of the Protocol in Guatemala, where it was used to grant permission to a non-commercial study on gene flow in mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) populations in the Maya Biosphere Reserve of Petén. On the basis of this study, we discuss five strategies to enhance the application of molecular genetics to conservation biology under the Nagoya Protocol: (1) generate short and standardized procedures; (2) enable science communication; (3) cultivate a common understanding between users, providers, and potential beneficiaries; (4) involve local research and practitioner organizations; and (5) integrate participatory research.

  {"id":"VincetiEtAl_2013","abstract":"Conservation priorities for Prunus africana, a tree species found across Afromontane regions, which is of great commercial interest internationally and of local value for rural communities, were defined with the aid of spatial analyses applied to a set of georeferenced molecular marker data (chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites) from 32 populations in 9 African countries. Two approaches for the selection of priority populations for conservation were used, differing in the way they optimize representation of intra-specific diversity of P. africana across a minimum number of populations. The first method (S1) was aimed at maximizing genetic diversity of the conservation units and their distinctiveness with regard to climatic conditions, the second method (S2) at optimizing representativeness of the genetic diversity found throughout the species’ range. Populations in East African countries (especially Kenya and Tanzania) were found to be of great conservation value, as suggested by previous findings. These populations are complemented by those in Madagascar and Cameroon. The combination of the two methods for prioritization led to the identification of a set of 6 priority populations. The potential distribution of P. africana was then modeled based on a dataset of 1,500 georeferenced observations. This enabled an assessment of whether the priority populations identified are exposed to threats from agricultural expansion and climate change, and whether they are located within the boundaries of protected areas. The range of the species has been affected by past climate change and the modeled distribution of P. africana indicates that the species is likely to be negatively affected in future, with an expected decrease in distribution by 2050. Based on these insights, further research at the regional and national scale is recommended, in order to strengthen P. africana conservation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Vinceti","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Loo","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Gaisberger","given":"Hannes"},{"family":"Zonneveld","given":"Maarten J.","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Schueler","given":"Silvio"},{"family":"Konrad","given":"Heino"},{"family":"Kadu","given":"Caroline A.

We genotyped 717 individuals from nine natural populations using microsatellite markers. The influence of distance, topography and habitat variables on spatial genetic structure was tested within the approaches of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-ecology. Species niche modeling was used to project the species theoretical range through time and space. The species showed high genetic diversity and moderate differentiation for which topography, progressive range contraction through the species’ history and long-term persistence in stable climatic refugia are likely responsible. A strong geographic component was revealed among five genetic clusters that are connected with very limited gene flow. The environmental variables were a significant factor in the spatial genetic structure. Modeling results indicated that future reduction of the species range may affect its survival.

  {"id":"WaldenEtAl_2020","abstract":"Adaptation to local climatic conditions is commonly found within species, but whether it involves the same intraspecific genomic variants is unknown. We studied this question in North American Arabidopsis lyrata, whose current distribution is shaped by post-glacial range expansion from two refugia, resulting in two distinct genetic clusters covering comparable climatic gradients. Using pooled whole-genome sequence data of 41 outcrossing populations, we identified loci associated with three niche-determining climatic variables in the two clusters and compared these outliers. Little evidence was found for parallelism in climate adaptation for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and for genes with an accumulation of outlier SNPs. Significantly increased selection coefficients supported them as candidates of climate adaptation. However, the fraction of gene ontology (GO) terms shared between clusters was higher compared to outlier SNPs and outlier genes, suggesting that selection acts on similar pathways but not necessarily the same genes. Enriched GO terms involved responses to abiotic and biotic stress, circadian rhythm and development, with flower development and reproduction being among the most frequently detected. In line with GO enrichment, regulators of flowering time were detected as outlier genes. Our results suggest that while adaptation to environmental gradients on the genomic level are lineage-specific in A. lyrata, similar biological processes seem to be involved. Differential loss of standing genetic variation, probably driven by genetic drift, can in part account for the lack of parallel evolution on the genomic level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Walden","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Lucek","given":"Kay"},{"family":"Willi","given":"Yvonne"}],"citation-key":"WaldenEtAl_2020","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.15338","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"n/a","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.15338","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Lineage-specific adaptation to climate involves flowering time in North American Arabidopsis lyrata","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.15338","volume":"n/a"},
  {"id":"WaldvogelEtAl_2020","abstract":"Global climate change (GCC) increasingly threatens biodiversity through the loss of species, and the transformation of entire ecosystems. Many species are challenged by the pace of GCC because they might not be able to respond fast enough to changing biotic and abiotic conditions. Species can respond either by shifting their range, or by persisting in their local habitat. If populations persist, they can tolerate climatic changes through phenotypic plasticity, or genetically adapt to changing conditions depending on their genetic variability and census population size to allow for de novo mutations. Otherwise, populations will experience demographic collapses and species may go extinct. Current approaches to predicting species responses to GCC begin to combine ecological and evolutionary information for species distribution modelling. Including an evolutionary dimension will substantially improve species distribution projections which have not accounted for key processes such as dispersal, adaptive genetic change, demography, or species interactions. However, eco-evolutionary models require new data and methods for the estimation of a species' adaptive potential, which have so far only been available for a small number of model species. To represent global biodiversity, we need to devise large-scale data collection strategies to define the ecology and evolutionary potential of a broad range of species, especially of keystone species of ecosystems. We also need standardized and replicable modelling approaches that integrate these new data to account for eco-evolutionary processes when predicting the impact of GCC on species' survival. Here, we discuss different genomic approaches that can be used to investigate and predict species responses to GCC. This can serve as guidance for researchers looking for the appropriate experimental setup for their particular system. We furthermore highlight future directions for moving forward in the field and allocating available resources more effectively, to implement mitigation measures before species go extinct and ecosystems lose important functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Waldvogel","given":"Ann-Marie"},{"family":"Feldmeyer","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Rolshausen","given":"Gregor"},{"family":"Exposito-Alonso","given":"Moises"},{"family":"Rellstab","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Kofler","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Mock","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Imke"},{"family":"Bataillon","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Savolainen","given":"Outi"},{"family":"Bergland","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Flatt","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Guillaume","given":"Frederic"},{"family":"Pfenninger","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"WaldvogelEtAl_2020","container-title":"Evolution Letters","DOI":"10.1002/evl3.154","ISSN":"2056-3744","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/evl3.154","page":"4-18","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evolutionary genomics can improve prediction of species’ responses to climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/evl3.154","volume":"4"},

Here, we sampled 39 species (36 temperate bamboos and 3 outgroups) for restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) with an emphasis on Phyllostachys clade and related clades. Using the largest data matrix for the bamboos to date, we were able to infer phylogenetic relationships with unparalleled resolution. The Phyllostachys, Shibataea, and Arundinaria clades defined from plastid phylogeny, were not supported as monophyletic group. However, the RAD-seq phylogeny largely agreed with the morphology-based taxonomy, with two clades having leptomorph rhizomes strongly supported as monophyletic group. We also explored two approaches, BWA-GATK (a mapping system) and Stacks (a grouping system), for differences in SNP calling and phylogeny inference. For the same level of missing data, the BWA-GATK pipeline produced much more SNPs in comparison with Stacks. Phylogenetic analyses of the largest data matrices from both pipelines, using concatenation and coalescent methods provided similar tree topologies, despite the presence of missing data.

  {"id":"WarrenEtAl_2008","abstract":"Environmental niche models, which are generated by combining species occurrence data with environmental GIS data layers, are increasingly used to answer fundamental questions about niche evolution, speciation, and the accumulation of ecological diversity within clades. The question of whether environmental niches are conserved over evolutionary time scales has attracted considerable attention, but often produced conflicting conclusions. This conflict, however, may result from differences in how niche similarity is measured and the specific null hypothesis being tested. We develop new methods for quantifying niche overlap that rely on a traditional ecological measure and a metric from mathematical statistics. We reexamine a classic study of niche conservatism between sister species in several groups of Mexican animals, and, for the first time, address alternative definitions of “niche conservatism” within a single framework using consistent methods. As expected, we find that environmental niches of sister species are more similar than expected under three distinct null hypotheses, but that they are rarely identical. We demonstrate how our measures can be used in phylogenetic comparative analyses by reexamining niche divergence in an adaptive radiation of Cuban anoles. Our results show that environmental niche overlap is closely tied to geographic overlap, but not to phylogenetic distances, suggesting that niche conservatism has not constrained local communities in this group to consist of closely related species. We suggest various randomization tests that may prove useful in other areas of ecology and evolutionary biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Warren","given":"Dan L."},{"family":"Glor","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Turelli","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"WarrenEtAl_2008","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x","page":"2868-2883","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Environmental Niche Equivalency Versus Conservatism: Quantitative Approaches to Niche Evolution","title-short":"Environmental Niche Equivalency Versus Conservatism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x","volume":"62"},

  {"id":"WarrenEtAl_2020","abstract":"Aim Species distribution models are used across evolution, ecology, conservation and epidemiology to make critical decisions and study biological phenomena, often in cases where experimental approaches are intractable. Choices regarding optimal models, methods and data are typically made based on discrimination accuracy: a model's ability to predict subsets of species occurrence data that were withheld during model construction. However, empirical applications of these models often involve making biological inferences based on continuous estimates of relative habitat suitability as a function of environmental predictor variables. We term the reliability of these biological inferences ‘functional accuracy.’ We explore the link between discrimination accuracy and functional accuracy. Methods Using a simulation approach we investigate whether models that make good predictions of species distributions correctly infer the underlying relationship between environmental predictors and the suitability of habitat. Results We demonstrate that discrimination accuracy is only informative when models are simple and similar in structure to the true niche, or when data partitioning is geographically structured. However, the utility of discrimination accuracy for selecting models with high functional accuracy was low in all cases. Main conclusions These results suggest that many empirical studies and decisions are based on criteria that are unrelated to models’ usefulness for their intended purpose. We argue that empirical modelling studies need to place significantly more emphasis on biological insight into the plausibility of models, and that the current approach of maximizing discrimination accuracy at the expense of other considerations is detrimental to both the empirical and methodological literature in this active field. Finally, we argue that future development of the field must include an increased emphasis on simulation; methodological studies based on ability to predict withheld occurrence data may be largely uninformative about best practices for applications where interpretation of models relies on estimating ecological processes, and will unduly penalize more biologically informative modelling approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Warren","given":"Dan L."},{"family":"Matzke","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Iglesias","given":"Teresa L."}],"citation-key":"WarrenEtAl_2020","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/jbi.13705","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jbi.13705","page":"167-180","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evaluating presence-only species distribution models with discrimination accuracy is uninformative for many applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.13705","volume":"47"},
  {"id":"WarrenEtAl_2021","abstract":"The ENMTools software package was introduced in 2008 as a platform for making measurements on environmental niche models (ENMs, frequently referred to as species distribution models or SDMs), and for using those measurements in the context of newly developed Monte Carlo tests to evaluate hypotheses regarding niche evolution. Additional functionality was later added for model selection and simulation from ENMs, and the software package has been quite widely used. ENMTools was initially implemented as a Perl script, which was also compiled into an executable file for various platforms. However, the package had a number of significant limitations; it was only designed to fit models using Maxent, it relied on a specific Perl distribution to function, and its internal structure made it difficult to maintain and expand. Subsequently, the R programming language became the platform of choice for most ENM studies, making ENMTools less usable for many practitioners. Here we introduce a new R version of ENMTools that implements much of the functionality of its predecessor as well as numerous additions that simplify the construction, comparison and evaluation of niche models. These additions include new metrics for model fit, methods of measuring ENM overlap, and methods for testing evolutionary hypotheses. The new version of ENMTools is also designed to work within the expanding universe of R tools for ecological biogeography, and as such includes greatly simplified interfaces for analyses from several other R packages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Warren","given":"Dan L."},{"family":"Matzke","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Cardillo","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"John B."},{"family":"Beaumont","given":"Linda J."},{"family":"Turelli","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Glor","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Huron","given":"Nicholas A."},{"family":"Simões","given":"Marianna"},{"family":"Iglesias","given":"Teresa L."},{"family":"Piquet","given":"Julien C."},{"family":"Dinnage","given":"Russell"}],"citation-key":"WarrenEtAl_2021","container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.05485","ISSN":"1600-0587","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecog.05485","page":"1-8","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"ENMTools 1.0: an R package for comparative ecological biogeography","title-short":"ENMTools 1.0","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.05485","volume":"44"},

We evaluate model performance using occurrence data generated from a known “true” initial Maxent model, using several different metrics for model quality and transferability. We demonstrate that models that are inappropriately complex or inappropriately simple show reduced ability to infer habitat quality, reduced ability to infer the relative importance of variables in constraining species' distributions, and reduced transferability to other time periods.

  {"id":"WarschefskyEtAl_2014","abstract":"The genetic diversity of our crop plants has been substantially reduced during the process of domestication and breeding. This reduction in diversity necessarily constrains our ability to expand a crop's range of cultivation into environments that are more extreme than those in which it was domesticated, including into “sustainable” agricultural systems with reduced inputs of pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Conversely, the wild progenitors of crop plants typically possess high levels of genetic diversity, which underlie an expanded (relative to domesticates) range of adaptive traits that may be of agricultural relevance, including resistance to pests and pathogens, tolerance to abiotic extremes, and reduced dependence on inputs. Despite their clear potential for crop improvement, wild relatives have rarely been used systematically for crop improvement, and in no cases, have full sets of wild diversity been introgressed into a crop. Instead, most breeding efforts have focused on specific traits and dealt with wild species in a limited and typically ad hoc manner. Although expedient, this approach misses the opportunity to test a large suite of traits and deploy the full potential of crop wild relatives in breeding for the looming challenges of the 21st century.

Multivariate analyses of structural data demonstrated that C. gynodynama is clearly distinct from C. mendocinensis, and that sterile specimens similar to C. mendocinensis are intermediate between that species and C. gynodynama. The mean genetic distance between the two species, based on allozyme phenotypes at 17 enzyme-coding loci, was 0.22 ± 0.12. The sterile putative hybrids had the expected heterozygous pattern at three enzyme-coding loci at which the parental species were fixed for different alleles. Chromosome numbers are reported for the first time for both species and their putative hybrid. Carex mendocinensis had a different number in each of the three populations examined with n = 28, n = 29, or n = 30. Chromosome counts from one population of C. gynodynama revealed five plants with n = 25 and one with n = 26. Putative hybrids from this population exhibited irregular pairing at meiosis with 2n = ca. 55–57. Patterns of allozyme variation also suggest that C. mendocinensis has an outcrossing or mixed mating system but that C. gynodynama is an inbreeding species. Carex gynodynama exhibited very little variation in structure, habitat, or at the enzyme-coding loci examined, suggesting that it may have experienced a genetic bottleneck relatively recently. Carex mendocinensis had higher levels of variation both within and between populations at enzyme-coding loci and in structural features. This pattern of variation and a geographic distribution centered in serpentine areas of the Klamath–Siskiyou region, with disjunct smaller populations in serpentine areas farther south, suggest that C. mendocinensis once may have been a more widespread species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Waterway","given":"Marcia J."}],"citation-key":"Waterway_1990","container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.1002/j.1537-2197.1990.tb14471.x","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.1537-2197.1990.tb14471.x","page":"826-838","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Genetic differentiation and hybridization between <i>Carex gynodynama</i> and <i>C. mendocinensis</i> (Cyperaceae) in California","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1537-2197.1990.tb14471.x","volume":"77"},

The meta-analysis provides aggregated evidence that invertebrate and plant diversity is lower in urban lawns under increased mowing intensity. This decline is independent of the level of contrast between mowing ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ (e.g. height or frequency of mowing), which differed considerably between studies. Intensive mowing also increases the occurrence of pest species (e.g. herbivorous beetle larvae and allergenic plants), though studies in this group were limited to northern environments. Changes in ecosystem-level variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit and carbon deficit) were less evident and suggest changes in abiotic processes may take longer to become apparent. An economic case study of the mowing costs in Trois-Rivières, Canada, suggests that cost savings of 36% may be possible with a modest reduction of mowing frequency. Synthesis and Applications. Increasing urban biodiversity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strong motivators for reducing lawn management intensity. We also suggest that the benefits of reducing pest species while saving lawn management costs may provide additional social and economic incentives for decision makers to review urban greenspace management practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Watson","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Carignan‐Guillemette","given":"Léonie"},{"family":"Turcotte","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Maire","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Proulx","given":"Raphaël"}],"citation-key":"WatsonEtAl_2020","container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.13542","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.13542","page":"436-446","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ecological and economic benefits of low-intensity urban lawn management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.13542","volume":"57"},

Evolutionary genetic considerations should be an important part of translocation strategies, but there is often confusion about concepts and goals. Here, we provide a classification of translocations based on specific genetic goals for both threatened species and ecological restoration, separating targets based on ‘genetic rescue’ of current population fitness from those focused on maintaining adaptive potential. We then provide a framework for assessing the genetic benefits and risks associated with translocations and provide guidelines for managers focused on conserving biodiversity and evolutionary processes.

In this article, we outline a guide to tackling distribution limits that integrates established causes, such as dispersal limitation and spatial environmental heterogeneity, with understudied causes, such as mutational load and genetic or developmental integration of traits limiting niche expansion. We highlight how modeling and quantitative genetic and genomic analyses can provide insight into sources of distribution limits.

  {"id":"WiszEtAl_2013","abstract":"Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km2 to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary and palaeoecological studies of individual species ranges, functional groups, and species richness patterns, we show that biotic interactions have clearly left their mark on species distributions and realised assemblages of species across all spatial extents. We demonstrate this with examples from within and across trophic groups. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wisz","given":"Mary Susanne"},{"family":"Pottier","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Kissling","given":"W.

Genome representation and complexity reduction are the basis for GBS fingerprinting and can vary by species based on genome size and other sequence characteristics. Grain amaranths are a set of three species that were domesticated in the New World to be high protein, pseudo-cereal grain crops. The goal of this research was to employ the GBS technique for diversity evaluation in grain amaranth accessions and close relatives from six Amaranthus species and determine genetic differences and similarities between groupings. A total of 10,668 SNPs were discovered in 94 amaranth accessions with ApeK1 complexity reduction and 10X genome coverage Illumina sequencing. The majority of the SNPs were species specific with 4,568 and 3,082 for the two grain amaranths originating in Central America Amaranthus cruentus and A. hypochondriacus and 3,284 found amongst both A. caudatus, originally domesticated in South America, and its close relative, A. quitensis. The distance matrix based on shared alleles provided information on the close relationships of the two cultivated Central American species with each other and of the wild and cultivated South American species with each other, as distinguished from the outgroup with two wild species, A. powellii and A. retroflexus. The GBS data also distinguished admixture between each pair of species and the geographical origins and seed colors of the accessions. The SNPs we discovered here can be used for marker development for future amaranth study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Xingbo"},{"family":"Blair","given":"Matthew W."}],"citation-key":"WuBlair_2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"YakimowskiEckert_2007","abstract":"Abstract: Geographically peripheral populations of widespread species are often the focus of conservation because they are locally rare within political jurisdictions. Yet the ecology and genetics of these populations are rarely evaluated in a broader geographic context. Most expectations concerning the ecology and evolution of peripheral populations derive from the abundant-center model, which predicts that peripheral populations should be less frequent, smaller, less dense, and have a lower reproductive rate than central populations. We tested these predictions and in doing so evaluated the conservation value of peripheral populations for the clonal shrub Vaccinium stamineum L. (Ericaceae, deerberry), which is listed as threatened in Canada. Based on 51 populations sampled from the center to the northern range limits over 2 years, population frequency and size declined toward the range limit, but ramet density increased. Sexual reproductive output varied widely among populations and between years, with many populations producing very few seeds, but did not decline toward range margins. In fact seed mass increased steadily toward range limit, and this was associated with faster germination and seedling growth, which may be adaptive in seasonal northern environments. Our results did not support the prediction that clonal reproduction is more prevalent in peripheral populations or that it contributed antagonistically to the wide variation in seed production. Peripheral populations of V. stamineum are as productive as central populations and may be locally adapted to northern environments. This emphasizes the importance of a broad geographical perspective for evaluating the ecology, evolution, and conservation of peripheral populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Yakimowski","given":"Sarah B."},{"family":"Eckert","given":"Christopher G."}],"citation-key":"YakimowskiEckert_2007","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00684.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00684.x","page":"811-822","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Threatened peripheral populations in context: geographical variation in population frequency and size and sexual reproduction in a clonal woody shrub","title-short":"Threatened Peripheral Populations in Context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00684.x","volume":"21"},

We present a chromosomal-scale genome of\n              V. darrowii\n              generated by the combination of PacBio sequencing and high throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi–C) scaffolding technologies, yielding a total length of 1.06 Gigabases (Gb). Over 97.8% of the genome sequences are scaffolded into 24 chromosomes representing the two haplotypes. The primary haplotype assembly of\n              V. darrowii\n              contains 34,809 protein-coding genes. Comparison to a\n              V. corymbosum\n              haplotype assembly reveals high collinearity between the two genomes with small intrachromosomal rearrangements in eight chromosome pairs. With small RNA sequencing, the annotation was further expanded to include more than 200,000 small RNA loci and 638 microRNAs expressed in berry tissues. Transcriptome analysis across fruit development stages indicates that genes involved in photosynthesis are downregulated, while genes involved in flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis are significantly increased at the late stage of berry ripening. A high-quality reference genome and accompanying annotation of\n              V. darrowii\n              is a significant new resource for assessing the evergreen blueberry contribution to the breeding of southern highbush blueberries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Jiali"},{"family":"Hulse-Kemp","given":"Amanda M."},{"family":"Babiker","given":"Ebrahiem"},{"family":"Staton","given":"Margaret"}],"citation-key":"YuEtAl_2021","container-title":"Horticulture Research","container-title-short":"Hortic Res","DOI":"10.1038/s41438-021-00641-9","ISSN":"2662-6810, 2052-7276","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"language":"en","page":"228","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"High-quality reference genome and annotation aids understanding of berry development for evergreen blueberry (Vaccinium darrowii)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41438-021-00641-9","volume":"8"},
