To Whom it May Concern,

Please find attached our manuscript for consideration for publication in
journal Botany.

This is a conservation assessment of a peripheral population Trichophorum
planifolium. We applied SSR markers to assess its genetic divergence, and
collected distribution, climate, and soil data to assess its spatial and
environmental characteristics relative to the core range of the species. We
intepret conservation implications of the results, in the context of
similar patterns documented in other sedge species with similar life
history characteristics.

The raw data for this study is currently available in the following github
repository: https://github.com/plantarum/trich . On acceptance, we will
transfer this to a suitable repository for archival storage (i.e.,
FigShare, Zenodo or similar).

Best,

Tyler Smith
